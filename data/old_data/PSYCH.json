                    "0": "The content was interesting and we often had good discussions, but the structure of the class was a little redundant, and it could get difficult to maintain a discussion for the whole class time every single class.",
                    "1": "Too much reading and writing.",
                    "2": "As someone who was not particularly interested in this topic coming into the seminar, I did not feel like it was the best use of my time. However I enjoyed class discussions in which people had differing opinions because it was actually interesting to discuss; at other times it felt like an echo chamber. Overall the writing was not too difficult because there aren't many different claims you can make on this topic so it was quite straightforward. It was definitely more work than I've heard other seminars are.",
                    "3": "– Dr. Pennington is a wonderful professor. She is very supportive of her students and she wants us to thrive. She gives really detailed feedback on sentence structure, grammar, organization, and topics covered in our weekly/midterm/final papers; She also takes the time to schedule out–of–class meetings with us if we need any assistance with planning our schedule, what classes to take, and feedback on our performance in the class. She is also a giggly person and I think that this makes the classroom environment a lot more welcoming. <br>– There are weekly writing assignments (at least for the majority of the quarter) and lengthy readings for every class. At times, it can be a bit difficult to balance out with a STEM class. However, there is a purpose behind these assignments and they have definitely enabled my growth and understanding of feminism and my performance in both verbal and written communication. <br>– Dr. Pennington is a wonderful and supportive professor and person  and I would recommend all freshman to take this class with her :)",
                    "4": "Overall this was very educating and not too much work, there was an essay due each week.",
                    "5": "Best Seminar, not just because it's a pretty lenient class but because of how kind Professor Gorvine is honestly. <br>Willard was a hike from the north campus, but honestly not a big deal, just take the bus.  <br>Professor Gorvine goes out of his way to make sure everyone feels welcomed and a part of the class.<br>The discussions were pretty consistent, as a student who is not a psychology major it's fun to hear what my classmates rant about because they go pretty in–depth and it's interesting.",
                    "6": "Readings were pretty time consuming and sometimes redundant. But the topic was super interested and we had very interesting discussions almost every class.",
                    "7": "If you are looking for a first quarter seminar, I highly highly recommend this class. Whether you are interested in psych or not, Professor Gorvine is simply a kind person who is willing to help you with anything, whether it's related to the class or advising. The class is structured so you do the readings before class and then discuss in class, and if you do the readings, it often results in interesting conversations. The readings can be a bit long, but they are usually interesting (and if you find they aren't, you can definitely skim and get the idea and still have a great discussion). We watched two films in class, and you are given the choice on which one you want to write a short paper about. Overall, there are two short papers (4 pgs) and one final research paper (8–10 pgs). Other than that, as long as you participate, show some interest, and engage with the readings, it's an enjoyable and easy first quarter seminar!",
                    "8": "LOVE this class and professor Gorvine. He is so nice and understanding and clearly cares a lot. I enjoyed the readings and being able to lead one class with my peers. Easy to stay engaged and not too much work. Easy A",
                    "9": "Professor Gorvine is extremely kind and a great professor.  Great seminar",
                    "10": "I enjoyed learned about the different types of mental health treatments and concerns people have about treatments (such as medicines having side effects). I think it made me reflect about the complexity of treating mental illnesses.",
                    "11": "This course definitely had a light content load, which was such a saving grace for my first quarter at NU. I loved the intimate, discussion–style format of this course, and I never felt intimidated to participate in class since Professor Gorvine was so kind. Also, the content was generally very interesting to talk about anyway.",
                    "12": "This course was just AMAZING. First of all, if you have the chance to take this as your freshman seminar, PLEASE DO. Professor Gorvine is genuinely the kindest, most incredible human and professor ever and he cares so much about his students. He made me feel so welcomed right off the bat and I could not IMAGINE taking a seminar with anyone else. He is truly the best and I am 100% sure my whole class thought so :) I also really enjoyed discussing the content of this course with other passionate individuals and I definitely have become more open–minded in regards to the issues and controversies in mental health diagnosis and treatment after taking this course.",
                    "13": "AMAZING CLASS!!! Readings were interesting, sometimes long, but ENGAGING. Just class discussions and three papers and you're done! Would recommend!!",
                    "14": "Overall, the class was well structured and fairly straight–forward. I was personally not super interested in the topics we were talking about, but they definitely can be engaging at times.",
                    "15": "TAKE THIS SEMINAR IF YOU CAN. Professor Gorvine is INSANELY GOOD. He is super nice, warm, supportive, and of course knowledgeable. He tries his best to make this course not only a pleasant intellectual journey but also a fun experience (e.g. he brings popcorns when we watch a movie in class; he takes us to starbucks reserve and gives us free giftcards; he invites us to his home for breakfast). THIS IS JUST AN AMAZING COURSE!!!",
                    "16": "Prof. Smith was so kind. The course wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be. It was kind of boring at times but I enjoyed Prof. Smith. If you are looking for a first year seminar, this is a good choice. Not much homework, only three essays due all quarter.",
                    "17": "I really appreciated the passion that Dr. Smith has towards this subject and how much he truly appreciates student involvement in his class.",
                    "18": "definitely recommend this class, especially if you are interested in music. really enjoyed having professor smith both as a professor and as a faculty advisor – he is very helpful if you seek out his assistance. three graded papers, two of which being research papers, which aren't that difficult, and readings for each class (readings aren't long and easy to skim, and if you don't do the readings, you won't fall behind). overall found the class very interesting.",
                    "19": "This course was a great introduction to the intricate connections between the brain and music. It truly helped me to see that these two typical individual fields of study have a lot of overlap, and the teacher is absolutely great and engaging and just a kind–hearted man in general. He only has your best interests at heart and is most interested in seeing your personal growth.  Take this class if you can!",
                    "20": "I enjoyed a lot of the videos that we watched in class because they were all music related. The lectures themselves weren't too engaging, but it may be due to the fact that I'm not too interested in psychology in general. However, the professor was very nice and was always trying to make the lectures interesting. The only major assignments in this course was one 2–3 page essay and two 4–5 page essays.",
                    "21": "teacher was awesome and very understanding. Explained all the concepts very well",
                    "22": "Very discussion based which was nice to have first quarter. Professor Smith is also extremely understanding towards students",
                    "23": "I enjoyed the content of the class and I would recommend it to anybody trying to pick a seminar that encompasses topics of music and psychology. I felt like the class was very laid back with the courseload as we only had readings to do before each class which were discussed during class. We had a total of 3 papers to write which were relatively easy as long as you follow the format required.",
                    "24": "I enjoyed the course, course materials were easily communicated and was easy to follow."

                    "1": "A good writing seminar for freshman. Every week, there is only one writing assignment that is short and not a formal essay and a few short readings. Very few graded assignments.  Rips is very passionate about the subject matter which makes lectures interesting to listen to, but they can feel long.",
                    "2": "Only two graded assignments with not much defined rubric for either. Difficult to gauge how you are doing in the class from a grade standard.",
                    "3": "The class involved lengthy weekly readings, and then we had to answer questions based on the readings. However, only one week of questions gets graded (he tells you which week so it's not a surprise). The class is less math focused and more psychology focused which I was a bit disappointed by. The grade is determined from three assignments which all have heavy weightings: one of the weekly set of questions that gets graded (30%), a final presentation (20%), and the final paper (50%). I only received feedback for the weekly set of questions and did not get any feedback for the final presentation (which is due before the final paper), nor did I receive feedback for the final paper. As such, I feel like my writing did not improve while taking this course. I do want to point out that for the most part, this course is relatively easy, with the exception of the three graded assignments. Additionally, we did not receive much direction on the final project/presentation, which some people may like or dislike.",
                    "4": "I was pretty excited at first to take this class on infinity since it had a strong connection to math and just seemed interesting. But this excitement wore off quick as I got into the class and having finished it, I feel like I did not learn anything new or useful. The lectures are dragged on for much longer than they need to and they could have been easily squished into a 30 minute time frame. It kind of felt like there was a big disconnect with the teacher as well because it felt like the same topics were being re–iterated over and over again, just with a slight little twist. We only got two big grades, and the feedback on our first paper came way too late, just as we were finishing up ideas for the second, final paper. I feel as though these two grades were not enough to demonstrate my understanding of the course and the rest of the assignments were mandatory but not even graded.",
                    "5": "Prof Rips is very obviously passionate about the course and its content. You get an written hw a week which are very doable although intellectually challenging which are graded for a completion except for one. There is a final research paper and make sure that your paper is somehow related to the course. Prof Rips is very willing to offer help in for the any of the assignments and your research paper."

She doesn't believe in deadlines and no assignment really has a strict due date. Reading materials can be time consuming but that's really the only thing in this course. Essays are open ended and are very easily graded, and she let's you resubmit for a better grade. Honestly, one of the best classes I've taken at this school and I recommend for anyone who wants a low workload writing seminar, especially when others are the opposite.",
                    "1": "I initially took this course because it was an \"easy\" writing seminar, but I am so glad I chose it. I found it so fulfilling, and it helped me change my perspective of the world. The combination of Buddhist and Psychological teachings helped me ease anxieties and stress, be more grateful, and overall live a better life. I think this will be my favorite course at Northwestern.",
                    "2": "I really loved this course. Professor Grabowecky is a very good teacher and her class is very interesting. I really learned a lot and I really enjoyed learning about the different mediation methods.",
                    "3": "Professor Grabowecky is an extremely good professor. Not only is she super understanding and kind, but she really cares about each individual as more than just a student. It feels like she genuinely wants all of us to succeed. One example I'll point to is the fact that we are allowed to revise essays for a higher grade, and we can get extensions for assignments if needed. Her outlook on teaching goes to show that she cares about us growing and learning. She is very fair with her grading and wants you to do as well as possible. Take this course with her if you have the chance! Meditating in class was very relaxing and set the mood for great in–class conversations.",
                    "4": "Very chill class.  Grabowecky basically talks the whole time for each class.  She has a very distinct ability to flow from conversation topic to conversation topic.  I can recall maybe only one class where at least half the class spoke during the whole hour and twenty minutes.  There are three one page meditation logs and three 3–page essays.  You meditate every class for about 10–15 minutes.  Very light class.  Would recommend for writing seminar.",
                    "5": "This was a very interesting &amp; easy class. You learn about mindfulness &amp; the basics of Buddhism, and the readings are pretty interesting. The first two papers were quite short &amp; straightforward, and the last paper was only 3–5 pages and there were a lot of different directions you could take it in. The classes mostly just consist of Professor Grabowecky talking about mindfulness &amp; Buddhism &amp; aren't very structured.",
                    "6": "Marcia is honestly the kindest soul I've met while at Northwestern. She is well–versed in this topic and has even published scientific research about it. Class is really chill and mostly just talking about Buddhism.",
                    "7": "Great course, would definitely take it again! Easy grading system and Prof. Grabowecky is super chill with deadlines. You only need to participate for a bit in class and the assignments do not take long.",
                    "8": "Lectures were boring at times and mostly consisted of Prof. Grabowecky talking about personal life stories that vaguely related to Buddhism psych. But if you're looking for an easy WCAS writing seminar, this is a great option. Only two \"major\" papers, which were each only 3–5 pages. There were also 4 meditation logs (1 page each) and weekly reading summaries (150 words each). The overall course content was interesting and the assignments were managable.",
                    "9": "Very solid class, low–stress workload and interesting content, just wished the content was a little more organized. We'd sort of just listen to Prof. Grabowecky talk about random stuff each week. Usually interesting stuff, but some organization would've helped me learn better.",
                    "10": "This class was great. Professor grabowecky is clearly very passionate a knowledgeable about what she does, and she is both flexible and accommodating as well as a good teacher.",
                    "11": "The course is a very good option for a writing seminar. I learned a lot about meditation and mindfulness practices of Buddhism Psychology and got the change to get exposed to such a habit. Weekly responsibilities include a short written summary for an assigned reading, 3 papers and 3 meditation logs. Completely manageable and the professor is very understanding and willing to help. The professor Grabowecky is a very interesting person overall with lots of research experience and it was interesting to hear about that, too. Sometimes though discussions were a bit dry especially because the class was taught at 3:30pm",
                    "12": "This course helped me learn about a subject I otherwise would have never had the opportunity to study and discuss. It also had many topics that were applicable to my daily life."

                    "0": "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS FOR AN EASY A. As a McCormick student looking for a humanities/social science theme requirement, I hated this class. Before I get into why I hated this class so much, I want to get one thing out of the way. I think Gardner is a great professor. She always tried to use relatable examples and make the class as engaging as possible by including activities that involved audience participation. It is clear that Gardner is incredibly passionate about what she teaches and that came across in her enthusiasm during lectures. <br><br>That being said, do not take this class if you don't absolutely LOVE memorising. Most of the grade is based on the midterms which are out of a raw mark of 50. You need a 94 to get an A in this class and there is no final. As most of the weight is from the 3 midterms, you need an average of around 47/50 to get an A. She does curve it to the highest mark, so you can expect to get 2 additional raw marks, meaning you can get by with a 45/50. There are also extra credit opportunities that allow you to get a total of 8 extra marks. This will add 3% to your grade. Although this seems reasonable, the tests require you to memorise a lot of things (even minor details) in the slides as well as the extra pages in the textbook that you need to self study. Added to this there are no practice exams. For a course that is primarily based on your exam performance, I find this ridiculous. Furthermore once you get your grade you will only be allowed to review what you got wrong during one particular 2 hour time slot. If you have a class during this time or anything else to do then tough luck you will never get to see your paper because your marked paper is not posted on canvas. Just to be clear, you will only have this one 2 hour time slot during the whole quarter to review your midterm paper. <br><br>But besides the exam you will have to take part in research studies as a participant in order to receive a grade for this class. The alternative to this is writing a 10–15 page research paper on any topic. Most people do not want to spend time writing a 10–15 pager on psychology, especially if they aren't extremely interested in psychology and are just taking the class to get a basic understanding of psychology which is what an intro class is supposed to be about. You should also not be nudged to take part in a study just to complete the class which is an INTRO class. <br><br>It is possible to get an A in this class by putting in a lot of effort, but is this worth it? ABSOLUTELY NOT. The amount of effort I had to put into this class and the constant stress of whether I can actually get an A or not was not worth it. After all that one may wonder, sure it's a lot of work but I can at least gain something useful out of the class. WRONG AGAIN. Coming out of this class, I do not think I gained anything extremely useful or practical. Neither did I come out a renewed and better person. This class only caused me misery. I would suggest not taking this class unless you really have to because it is a major requirement for you. <br><br>Overall I think this class could be made more enjoyable if it was not terribly structured and there was less stress on memorising everything to get a good mark in the exams.",
                    "1": "Prof Gardner is a beyond amazing professor; she was beyond my favorite. She was able to get a lecture hall of 300 students interested and excited about psychology by interacting with them us with videos, examples, jokes, and activities for us to participate in. Super enthusiastic, patient, approachable, funny, and intelligent. Also, the class has like zero work its so so easy. The exams took a lot of people off guard because, other than a take–home, quick quiz once a week we didn't really do anything else with the information so people didn't prepare well. I took the weekend before to make and go over flashcards, which worked well for me. Also, the exams aren't cumulative. However, they do have A, B, C, A+B, none of the above, all of the above, A+C, B+C and that kind of stuff.",
                    "2": "The lectures themselves were excellent; Professor Gardener is an excellent lecturer. I was less pleased when I discovered that the lectures only cover 80% of the content in this class. The other 20% of the content we were asked to read from the textbook. I, personally, don't learn well when simply reading material out of a textbook, and I did not enjoy that portion of the class.",
                    "3": "This course was AMAZING. I've always wanted to take a psychology course but it never fit into my schedule until now. 10/10 recommend taking it with Professor Gardner. She's super interesting and engaging (and funny), and she doesn't just read off the slides but adds extra information. Not all of the information she talks about needs to go into your notes, but the information on the slides definitely does since that's what makes the bulk of the exams. The slides are posted after every lecture, though, so I suppose I would prioritize writing down what she says if you can't write it all down fast enough and just go over the notes after. Professor Gardner also had great pace with the slides—she wasn't taking forever to get through all the information or going so fast you couldn't focus on what she was saying.<br>We had mini–quizzes every Sunday and an extra–credit assignment every other Sunday (I think). The mini–quizzes aren't hard and you can use your notes; for the most part I retained most of the information from the lectures so I didn't need to, but if you're typing your notes like I did, ctrl+f is your friend. Also the mini–quizzes (and exams) referenced information from the book (an actually interesting textbook), which went more into depth than the slides, so I highly recommend getting the book (or renting it out or whatever). Or you could do what I did and mooch off of a friend :D<br>As for studying for exams, I'm trash at studying and only really started studying for exams that weekend (our exams were on Tuesday). Basically, I would study Sunday, maybe Monday, and then do a last minute recap sesh before the class on Tuesday. I consistently got 90s (even on one that I barely studied for), so if you put more effort in than me, you'll definitely do better. Also Professor Gardner posts study guides for the book, so I only read the chapters that were going to be referenced on the exam. And the exams aren't cumulative.<br><br>TLDR: If you need to take a course to fulfill a requirement and this class is on your radar, TAKE IT WITH PROFESSOR GARDNER!!! You won't regret it.",
                    "4": "The presence of extra credit, as well as superb lecture slides and lecturer, as well as a very forgiving test schedule, make this class a must–take. Cannot recommend this class enough as a FD and was an absolute breeze. Readings were only needed for the test and Professor Gardner posts a textbook reading study guide that shortens it down to the absolute necessary.",

You should definitely take it if you're interested in psychology but be warned that the midterms make up a huge part of your grade and require a solid understanding of the many topics covered in the course.  However, unless you do the extra credit, you don't have to write any essays, and Gardner is a fantastic professor.",
                    "6": "I loved lecture and learning about psychology, and if you’ve never taken a psych course before this one will introduce you well. Prof Gardner is a great lecturer, and all the lectures were interesting and engaging. However, I did not like the exam/assignment format. I get that this class is almost 300 people, and thus it’s hard to make more in depth assignments and get them all graded, but I felt like the exams were entirely based on memorization of terms and definitions. I wish there were more interpretative and analysis assignments, like a paper or two (not just for extra credit or to get out of research) that allowed for more creative analysis and ideation about what we learned. I learned a lot more in this class and enjoyed it much more than my final grade will show, simply because I didn’t memorize every little detail for the exams. And while I know that’s entirely my own fault, I really wish there was some other type of assignment that is a bigger part of the course.",
                    "7": "This course is interesting and Dr. Gardner does a pretty good job of keeping the lecture engaging, however, the hour and a half–length makes the class monotonous at times. DO NOT underestimate the difficulty of the 3 exams. You WILL have to study for them.",
                    "8": "This course was engaging. All the information presented is really interesting and and related to some of the things seen around us. I could look forward to the class every week.",
                    "9": "Prof is great! Lots of content to learn.",
                    "10": "I really liked the course even though it was challenging. You have mini quizzes every week which were open notes so that was easy points. The only thing was the the exams were application problems so you have to know the concepts",
                    "11": "Great distro, great professor. If you took AP Psych in high school, this is essentially the same course. Prof Gardner is the best!",
                    "12": "This class is very interesting. There is not much homework but there is a lot of material on the Exams.",
                    "13": "Slightly repetitive to people who have taken a psychology course before. Pretty engaging lectures. Slightly difficult to take notes on everything in class but aside from that not bad at all.",
                    "14": "Loved this class, learned a lot, great professor, and there wasn't too much work",
                    "15": "There was a lot of interesting information presented, but the course was overwhelming at times and uninteresting in the beginning.",
                    "16": "pretty easy course with very good lectures and a good structure to follow and do well in. The most annoying part of this course is the lab requirement. It was so inconvenient and tedious and took way too much time.",
                    "17": "I really enjoyed the focus on emotions and psychological disorders specifically, as I felt that how everything connected was just fascinating and Professor Gardner did a great job filling in the holes that the textbook skimmed over..",
                    "18": "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Professor Gardner is such a good professor and the material covered in this course is so interesting. Every single time I was in that class, my mind was blown at least once. Even if you don't need this for your major this is such a good foundational discipline class or elective so absolutely take it!! Also, there is pretty much no homework involved. There is one weekly discussion board that is really simple and due every Thursday night, and then there is a mini quiz due every Sunday night, but it is open note and untimed, and that's it. The tests are very straightforward, just make a bunch of flashcards and drill them a lot and you'll be good.",
                    "19": "Great slides designed to drill in information with clarity and relevant examples–very great in preparing students for exams",
                    "20": "Not bad for an intro psych course, just tedious at times. 3 exams, all curved to the highest score, with weekly discussion posts and mini–quizzes, which are basically free points if you do them. The whole class is points–based, but also includes 4 extra credit opportunities. Exams are all multiple choice, so just make a bunch of flashcards and memorize them and you'll do fine. Prof. Gardner is nice and a decent lecturer, but her slides often are too wordy (but still pretty good though). The one annoying part of the class is the lab requirement, which basically forces you to do ~7.5 hours of participation in psychological studies or write a research paper by the end of the quarter. But overall not bad if you put in the work.",
                    "21": "Not a super easy A, but definitely manageable if you put in the work. Study for midterms. Attend all lectures cause most of the exam questions come from lectures. 3 midterms, 4 extra credit papers worth 2 points each, weekly discussion posts and open notes quizzes",
                    "22": "This course is great. The professor is engaging, the exams are doable with proper preparation, and the content is engaging and relevant.",
                    "23": "This course was very interesting and we covered so much. The structure of the class I really liked because there was not that much more outside of class if you paid attention in class.  Professor Gardner is so so so nice and so passionate about the class. Even though the lecture is long and can be hard to pay attention to throughout the whole time (just because of my own attention capabilities), Professor Gardner makes it so fun. She clearly loves what she teaches and it makes the class awesome. People applauded when she finished her final lecture which I wouldn't have done for my other professors. In terms of grades, the class is really fair. The only work you have to do outside of class is studying for the midterms which are pretty fair. If you work hard and memorize things you can do well in the class; they don't take the full two hours but can have tricky questions. There are also discussion posts but they are pretty much for completion.",
                    "24": "Overall pretty easy class, but you really do have to spend a lot of time studying for the exams and the multiple choice can be hard. You don’t really have to go to the actual lectures because slides are published. I barely went to class and still got an A but that being said it’s still not an easy A because I had to do a lot of learning outside of class.",
                    "25": "I LOVE Wendi Gardner",
                    "26": "There is not a lot of work to do outside of class, but YOU NEED TO STUDY FOR EXAMS. You cannot cram for them. You need to study ahead of time.  Studying for the exams are the hardest part. There are 3 non–cumulative exams, no final, and weekly quizzes that are taken at home with open notes.  They say the exams are not mere–memorization, but you can memorize and have a pretty good grasp of the application questions. You must also read the textbook for the exam. Not too in–depth, but just skim and when you see the questions, it will jog your memory.",
                    "27": "I really enjoyed this class. The material was engaging and the homework load was light which was pretty nice.",
                    "28": "All the exams tested are in the lecture slides and required textbook readings. Did not need to attend lecture after the first week and still did fine in the class.",
                    "29": "Many people try to say this class is an easy A, but you need to invest time into studying and a lot of memorization.",
                    "30": "This course was really interesting and a great intro to psychology. Professor Gardner does a good job at providing various examples to apply to psychology ideas. It does go by extremely fast and often information overload in the 80 min class time. I highly recommend going to lecture to learn the best, you can just read the textbook but a lot of that information is unnecessary if it wasn't mentioned in the lecture.",
                    "31": "The class itself is definitely very easy, especially in comparison to engineering classes. Although people say it is heavy on memorization, a lot of the content is very easy and intuitive to memorize. Going to class is definitely very important because not only is it interesting, but it also makes remembering different topics much easier. Reading the textbook is not necessary, and only has to be done in preparation for each midterm, where prof. Gardner posts the different pages that should be read. Overall, a very interesting class thanks to prof Gardner and an easy A.",
                    "32": "I really loved this class and it helped me to develop a great base in psychology. Wendi is an AWESOME teacher and very engaging in the lectures. There are 3 tests throughout the quarter and as long as you study and know how to apply the terms they are not too hard at all.",
                    "33": "Professor Gardner is so enthusiastic, and her care towards what she is teaching is so present. She makes the course all the more enjoyable, and creates such a safe space to ask questions. She also always has examples pertaining to the concepts she is teaching in order to help keep us engaged during lectures. The work is super manageable – but definitely spend time understanding the concepts, rather than just memorizing. Your grade relies heavily on the exams, so actually study and go to office hours if needed (there are so many, both with Professor Gardner and the TAs).",
                    "34": "The lectures in this class were really engaging and effective at communicating all the material we needed to learn. The use of the textbook is only supplementary and the readings were all very manageable and nicely complimented what we were learning in class.",
                    "35": "Pretty solid course even if you don't need it for a major requirement. Provides for a pretty well–paced study of psych.",
                    "36": "Taught basics of psychology, all memorization, hard to study for",
                    "37": "Good introduction course, briefly highlights a bit of everything in psych and doesn't go super deep. I'd say unless your going into psych as a major/minor, you don't have to focus too much on this class. Primarily just memorization, exams are non–cumulative so I would make a quizlet 2 days before the exam, memorize everything on it and did well on all the exams. You also don't need to read the whole text book, just the chapters she posts in a study guide about 1–2 weeks before the exam. Weekly discussion posts (quick) and open note quizzes (all the answers are in the slides she posts) are easy points, as well as extra credit papers offered (they take like 20 min to do each). You have to participate in studies which is kind of cool, but a little stressful with scheduling to make sure you get your credits in.  I didn't go to lectures and just looked at the slides to take notes on about half way through the quarter to use my time for more rigorous classes and that worked well for me.",
                    "38": "This class was really informative and interesting. Professor Gardener is a great lecturer and really makes you interested in the topics.",
                    "39": "If you're looking for an easy A elective or distro look somewhere else. All that needs to be said.",
                    "40": "I think the course did exactly as I wanted it to. No surprises. Just an interesting psych course.",
                    "41": "I thought this course was great to learn basic information about psychology. My enjoyment of this class (the instruction and content) has inspired me to take another course this next quarter.",
                    "42": "I really enjoyed taking this class, and I think one of the highlights was most definitely taking it with Wendi Gardner! Her lectures were always very interesting, and the exams were fair. The class was not difficult, and the professor always managed to make the material interesting. I would highly recommend taking the class even if you aren't interested in majoring in psychology.",
                    "43": "Professor Gardner is a wonderful lecturer who teaches the material in a very engaging and memorable way. Make sure you come to class, because it will be so much harder to study for the test if you weren't in class. PSYCH 110–0 is a really fun class with so much interesting material, covering a wide breadth of intro psychology content. There are discussion posts each week (a few sentences about what you thought was interesting this week in lectures), a ~5–question open–book at–home quiz each week. There are also three non–cumulative 50–question multiple choice tests spaced evenly throughout the class, and with each one is an extra credit assignment which involves writing an answer to a psychology question using your new psychology knowledge. You need to have the textbook, and Professor Gardner will tell you which chapters you have to read, and questions from those chapters will be on the multiple choice tests. If you read the textbook, attend lectures, and study your notes, you will get an A in the class.",
                    "44": "Amazing course. Captivating, taught all the content extremely clearly. Great psych overview.",
                    "45": "this class is interesting and can go smoothly if you do more than just memorize.",
                    "46": "Overall, the work load for this class was relatively light throughout the week. There are 3 multiple choice exams spread throughout the quarter, so when those exams come around, the workload increases due to the need to study for these exams. The exams are manageable if you study a great amount, but I found them quite challenging. Other than that, there is very few homework assignments and the notes are posted from lectures.",
                    "47": "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE IF YOURE LOOKING FOR AN EASY A. I took it cause I’m a Psych major and it was a challenging course. It has weekly open notes quizzes, 3 midterms (no finals), 13 lab credits (if you’re 18+ you can do them by participating in studies and if you’re not you need to write a paper) and 3 extra credit papers. The midterms are HARD. You often have to memorize at least 60 slides + textbook pages per midterm and the exams demand you to know all the names/terms/concepts/studies in a lot of detail. If memorization is not for you, I dont recommend taking the class. The professor is AMAZING, however. She is very passionate about the course and is very accessible. I hated the fact the class is so big. You can’t ask questions and you don’t feel like you matter in the course.",
                    "48": "The course is great! Professor Gardner is fantastic, and her lectures are super engaging with examples that really help you soak all of the info in. It's a good distro and not a ton of work, but you definitely have to put in a good chunk of time into studying for the exams, which I thought were very fair. Overall it was a great introductory psych class and I would definitely take it with Professor Gardner.",
                    "49": "This course was a great course for filling out a distribution requirement. It was not super challenging, yet it was super interesting. Highly recommend this class.",
                    "50": "Professor Gardner is an excellent teacher that truly demonstrates passion for the subject. Her lectures are relevant and stimulating. The workload is light, and the exams are easy if you study. This class is an easy A .",
                    "51": "The class has 3 exams (about 50 questions), weekly small open–note quizzes (usually 3–6 questions), weekly small discussion posts, and 4 different opportunities for extra credit. The class functions like a basic large lecture hall (taking notes from the slides).<br><br>Professor Gardner is an AMAZING instructor. She always keeps class interesting, is open to answering questions at any point, and you can tell she really enjoys the subject.<br><br>The class is not difficult by any means. As long as you take notes, read the designated chapters of the text book, keep up with the quizzes and discussion posts, and take the time to study for each exam you should do just fine!",
                    "52": "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Intro to Psychology was so much fun!!! I really enjoyed going to lecture because Professor Gardner was so engaging and made everything so interesting. There is a discussion board post due every Thursday and a reply to another classmate due by Saturday. Every Sunday there is a short multiple choice quiz that is open book open notes. There are three exams throughout the course but there isn't a cumulative final, which is super nice. In addition to the lecture, there are additional textbook readings that you will need to take notes on to study for the tests. Some of this information isn't covered in lecture because there isn't enough time. Make sure to do the readings assigned because that information will show up on the exams. Outside of class material, there is a lab component to the class. You get to be a participant in psychology studies being conducted by Northwestern students. The labs are super interesting and chill. However, it is a lot of logistics to figure out as you have to sign up and schedule times to do labs. If you don't want to do this, you can also opt out for a 10–15 page research paper. On weeks that I didn't have an exam, I spent less than an hour on the class. However, the week leading up to an exam takes up more time. Overall, this class is super interesting and really fun! I cannot recommend Professor Gardner enough!",
                    "53": "This course was a requirement for my major. And it was a very nice class. Prof. Gardner is amazing and really knows her stuff. Take this class with her for sure. Low workload, just a discussion post and short quiz every week and then three tests (no final). Learn a lot of cool stuff as well.",
                    "54": "I really learned a lot in this class. Sometimes tests were a bit hard, I wish they weren't all multiple choice. But a super engaging class and a great distribution requirement.",
                    "55": "Psych 110–0 with Professor Gardner has been one of my favorite classes I've taken at Northwestern. She is an incredible lecturer, funny, knowledgeable, and engaging. You can tell that she not only cares for and is passionate about the material, but also cares that we are excited about it too. This class was incredibly light, while still teaching me a lot. There were three non–cumulative exams which were fairly easy to study for because instead of rote memorization, you just had to understand the concepts. You have discussion posts and open–note quizzes which basically act as nice easy gpa boosters. Other than that, you had some psych studies you had to be a part of, but all of them were simple, sometimes fun, and I usually got them done very early (10 minutes as opposed to 30 minutes).  The only hard part was keeping up with the text book reading, but Gardner gives you a study guide explaining which sections you'll be tested on, so you can just wait until she releases the study guide to start. Overall, easy class, fun class, learned a lot, will be taking more psych classes as a result.",
                    "56": "Don’t be scared by other CTECS. the class averages are low for an intro course, but if you study the tests are an easy b+\\a– and there’s tons of extra credit and tests have good curves. Gardner is GREAT!!",

                    "59": "I greatly enjoyed taking this course! Personally, I took it as one of my distros and also because I'm premed. I was a little worried going in because I had never taken a psychology class before in high school or in college, but Professor Gardner was really helpful in making the material more engaging and easy to understand. Her lectures are AMAZING. She takes the time to go in–depth about different subjects and I like how she uses a lot of different psych studies to supplement each topic. <br><br>I think Professor Gardner is one of the best professors I've had at Northwestern; she's extremely passionate about what she teaches and she takes the time so that students understand the material. Her exams are very fair; there's no trick questions and she makes study guides beforehand telling you which parts of the textbook in addition to the lecture notes will be on the exams. Additionally, she provides a lot of extra credit opportunities and curves exam scores, which is really helpful in boosting grades.<br><br>There's a small lab requirement for this course in which you participate in psychology research, and I actually enjoyed this part too. Participating as a research subject is actually kind of fun and low–stress, and I was able to finish all of my studies earlier in the quarter, which meant that I had no work for this course after Thanksgiving. This was especially nice since that meant I had one less class to stress about for final exams.<br><br>Overall, I think this was a great course and a somewhat easy A. If you need to take a social and behavioral sciences distro, I'd highly recommend taking this one!",
                    "60": "She did a great job teaching and was super engaging. I would say that she covers A TON of information in each class so the exams are PACKED with content. There is very little work outside of studying for the exams because that takes a lot of time and effort. The extra credit papers are awesome grade boosters.",
                    "61": "Gardner is an absolutely amazing professor. She does a magnificent job at engaging everyone and making course material interesting. The class itself is not difficult at all with three non–cumulative exams throughout the quarter and some discussion posts. Overall, would take this class again just for the vibes, honestly.",

                    "63": "This class is great. Pretty fun (prof Gardner is a great lecturer!) and not too much work. There are weekly quizzes on Canvas which are pretty easy (always multiple choice, never more than 6 questions) as well as weekly discussion posts (1 or 2 sentences each, not too bad). Other than that, the only work for the class is studying for the exams, which are non–cumulative and multiple choice. Great class, would definitely take again if I could. Take it!",
                    "64": "This class can teach you a lot about yourself, which is really unexpected. Exams are really fair as long as you pay attention and take notes in lecture. Prof. Gardner is a great lecturer and you can tell how enthusiastic she is about psychology!",
                    "65": "This is a great introductory class with the awesome Professor Gardner. Prof. Gardner lectures extremely well, keeping you engaged and interested. Sometimes the lectures started to drag, but we were usually let out a little early. This course definitely covers a lot of material and moves quickly so having good, organized notes is important. The structure of assignments are extremely consistent and not overbearing at all.",
                    "66": "IF YOU NEED A DISTRO REQUIREMENT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Professor Gardner is AMAZING! She had so much passion for the subject. While this class is VERY lecture heavy, she tried to make it interesting by having some really fun demos in class. Also she makes sure to post all the slides online which definitely helps if you need to miss class. It was really great how we didn't have a final or midterms– instead it was just 3 non–cumulative exams. I'd probably recommend studying for the exam the weekend of. It definitely helps making a vocab set since there are a TON of terms to learn. If you knew all of the vocab the tests were pretty fair. Also I'd definitely recommend doing all the extra credit. You can't miss a lot of points, if I remember right its 18, to get an A. It'd be the worst if you were only a few points off and the extra credit would've helped you– they also don't take long at all. Besides lecture material, we also had specific textbook sections we needed to know but they were never too long and didn't make up a big portion of the exam.  We also had weekly discussion posts and open note quizzes– make sure to keep track of them! The only other part of the class is participating in research studies– definitely get them done as soon as you can! Also, we finished by Thanksgiving Break which was great! SO YEAH TAKE THIS CLASS!!!",

                    "69": "Professor Gardner is a great lecturer and presents most content in a really engaging way. This class definitely took a good amount of studying to really know the concepts and all the content covered. I would start studying a couple days before exams in order to pace myself, but it was still a lot of content to cover to feel good about going into the exam. The 3 non–cumulative exams was really nice rather than a cumulative final because so much content is covered.",
                    "70": "Overall a good class. The professor was very enthusiastic about the topic. Coursework was pretty light, and I liked how the exams were noncumulative. Recommend to take if you're looking for an easygoing class.",
                    "71": "It is a great introduction course which covers a lot of different school of thoughts in psychology so you get exposed to a range of ideas and theories. Professor Gardner is great too! This course is very memorisation heavy and the exams are multiple choice although they can get tricky so it is important to stay on top of all content consistently. It moves at quite a fast pace but it is manageable. Great intro course overall.",
                    "72": "This course was a great introduction to psychology, although we didn't delve very deeply into the various subjects presented.  It felt like a shallow dip into many fields, although we still learned a lot.",
                    "73": "Please takes this class with Prof. Gardner. Psychology is already a subject that is intuitively interesting (you know, since you are literally learning about yourself). But beyond that, the professor really made this class. The way she teaches is just mesmerising and incredibly fun to listen to. For all the exams you just have multiple choice tests and the only content you must know (expect the readings) is written on the class presentations. Hence, all the content was very organized and easy to get through. Also, loved that the assessments  were not cumulative, really made your life easier.",
                    "74": "This course was incredibly interesting as most of the concepts could be applied to my life, which made learning much easier and lots of fun.",
                    "75": "I loved this class! For an intro class, Prof. Gardner is great and knows how to keep you interested. I really loved getting to discuss the concepts that we did, and there was always an interesting study or example we discussed in class that I wanted to share with someone. Preparing for the exams in this class can kind of be stressful, but there are only three non–cumulative exams and no final, so the class isn't generally that stressful. This class turned me into a psychology double major!",
                    "76": "The infectious passion of the professor, manageable workload, and clear guidelines on what to study for and know before a midterm actually allowed me to learn life–long lessons through this class about how to learn and approach thinking.",

                    "78": "I was surprised that we learned a lot about mental  illnesses and medication. This was very important for me to understand better and I was happy that we talked about it. I was surprised that we learned so much about the brain and the science behind psychology but it was still interesting.",
                    "79": "I definitely underestimated the difficulty of this course. There are three tests which make up most of your grade and no final. The professor is nice and her lectures were fun to listen to, but the tests were SO hard for me. The questions are very trickily worded, with a lot of them being those questions that have answer A, answer B, answer C, answers A &amp; B, and all of the above (with very difficult/ambiguous answers to choose from). Also, there is hardly any curve for the tests. There is just so much memorization for this class, which I definitely wasn't prepared for. I found myself really struggling, but I think that if you put in the work it's a doable class.",
                    "80": "I'd always been really interested in psychology, but I hadn't had an opportunity to take a class. This probably was one of the best intro classes I've ever taken in anything! Looking back in hindsight, we covered so much content, and yet it never felt that overwhelming. Every lecture was so engaging and it managed to give such a thorough overview of every field within psychology.",
                    "81": "Don't let the overall hours spent on the course per week deceive you because the 3 midterms require lots of memorization, often at times when there are exams or papers due in other courses. The 13 lab credits can also be tricky to squeeze into your schedule and many labs did not open scheduling until Nov. 1. I ended up switching to a P/N grade. It is easy to miss points on the multiple choice midterms, especially if this is your first psych course.",
                    "82": "It's a big seminar college course, where you look at some slides twice a week and have a multiple choice test every now and then. There's also some little multiple choice mini quizzes and discussion posts on canvas that I always forgot to do. It's a fun, interesting, very general survey psych course, where every now and then you'll go 'huh, that's kinda cool.', but you could probably get a similar educational outcome reading a textbook, taking a MOOC, or watching some lectures on Youtube. Gardner is a great professor.",
                    "83": "This is a great class to fulfill the social and behavioral science classes. It is relatively easy with very little weekly work. The lectures are pretty standard, just a presentation from slides and nothing beyond basic, standard material.",
                    "84": "I went into the course knowing nothing about psych, and now I feel like I know a lot—really great class for anyone coming in with zero knowledge.",
                    "85": "Very interesting course. The exams were challenging but you should be fine as long as you study the lecture material and read the textbook.",
                    "86": "Test were difficult and the curve for them were minimal since most of the students had taken psych before. Other than that, interesting class.",
                    "87": "I genuinely loved this class. It was super interesting and I learned a lot that will be useful beyond the classroom. I highly recommend going to as many lectures as possible, as I found them much more useful to my learning than reading the textbook. Do everything in your power to not miss class, because Professor Gardner covers a lot of material in one lecture, and it's easy to fall behind. She's an excellent lecturer, and you can really take a lot away from this class if you put forth the effort. Go to class, study early, and you'll do well.",
                    "88": "Overall I would recommend taking this course! Professor Gardner is very engaging and charismatic; she is very passionate and knowledgeable about the material.  I think the workload was manageable from week to week: the weekly quizzes and discussion board posts are very easy to get full credit on, However, I think the most troubling thing about this class are the exams. The class is out of 300 points and each exam is worth 80 points each (together 240).  Each one was inclusive of a lot of material (she also expects you to know information from textbook readings that we didn't go over at all in class which was a little annoying), and if you are not the best test–taker it may be a bit of a struggle. Each exam is 50 questions multiple choice, and the answers choices can be very tricky. Especially on the first exam I was overwhelmed by the amount of choices that were like \"a and b\", \"c and d\", \"all of the above\".  I think it's a format worth getting used to, but I think if you take the time you can adjust to it. Also take advantage of the extra credit opportunities! The first 3 were only 2 points each but they were still definitely worth doing.",
                    "89": "Interesting course, moves really fast, requires a lot of memorization. Exams aren't difficult, just a lot of content.",
                    "90": "I enjoyed how the professor used case studies to talk about the terms.",
                    "91": "This class covered a lot of content across various fields in psychology. It is extremely engaging, and it is evident how applicable these topics are to real life.  The weekly discussion posts and quizzes are also very manageable.",
                    "92": "It's an easy distro but you still learn A LOT",
                    "93": "This course taught me a range of topics from parts of the brain to therapy and mental illness.",
                    "94": "I really enjoyed this class, especially because of the way professor Gardener taught it. She was an engaging lecturer, and put a lot of the info on the slides. The exams were fair, and everything came from the slides or textbook. We had few assignments, and they were easy to do well on.",
                    "95": "I really enjoyed professor Gardner's lectures. They were stimulating and encouraged my learning in the subject.  The weekly quizzes had no time limit and were very simple. The extra credit papers are easy and definitely worth doing. The online discussions do not take long, so do not forget to do these!",
                    "96": "I personally didn't like the way the course the graded because it is so exam–focused. but the lectures were easily understandable, it just requires a lot of memorization.",
                    "97": "Wendi Gardener was a fantastic instructor! I came in with a tremendous interest in psychology and was not disappointed intellectually despite the broad, surface level approach to the subject matter which an introductory level course necessitates.  Her teaching style is accessible, well–structured and even humorous at times. The workload outside of class is very manageable; however, I would not recommend cramming for the exams (of which there are 3) as they cover quite a large breadth of material. They are not particularly challenging conceptually, but it can be a lot to remember! Form study groups and find ways to apply the material to your own life (something the course itself even emphasizes!). Finished the course feeling like I retained a good chunk of the information and excited to pursue further education on the subject. As a freshman taking this course during their first fall quarter, I cannot praise the instructor enough for providing a well–rounded, informative and approachable introduction to Northwestern's academics!",
                    "98": "This class was extremely fun to learn! The professor was very chill. I highly recommend it.",
                    "99": "My goal of the this course was to get introduced to the concepts of psychology, and I would say that was what I achieved.",
                    "100": "Everything was good",
                    "101": "Fantastic course. Very fair exams and can do well if you know the material well. Prof. Gardner is amazing.",
                    "102": "The class presented a large chunk of material effectively, but was somewhat lacking in engagement, and the tests were largely rote memorization.",
                    "103": "I feel like this class is very straightforward. Go to lecture, listen, take good notes, and study in the right ways and you will succeed. I quite liked the lectures, especially when the Professor would pull some psychological tricks on the students or told stories/showed videos of experiments in order to drive home the points of certain concepts. I did however think that the lab requirement portion of this class was a bit redundant, but there were a few labs I took part in that were interesting. Other than that, I would say the class is fine and it's a good class to take if you have some interest in learning more about psychology.",
                    "104": "I really enjoyed this course and thought the lectures were overall very interesting.  I really liked Professor Gardner, and she moves very quickly, but she posts the slides after class so it's ok if you don't get everything down in class. I also really liked that there were many opportunities to get your grade up and that your grade was not only based on the 3 exams.",
                    "105": "Professor Gardner is arguably the one to take this class with. she is clearly knowledgeable about the topics which shows in her slides and presentations. there was not an excessive work outside of class and it was constructed to support you.",
                    "106": "I LOVED this class! Professor Gardner is such a great lecturer. Her slides are jam–packed with information (which can sometimes feel like a lot), but they're super helpful when reviewing for exams. There are three non–cumulative midterms, NO FINAL EXAM, and weekly reading take–home reading quizzes and discussion posts. The workload outside of class was super light! I did have to study quite a bit before each exam just because the amount of material covered on each exam is a lot, but literally everything you need to know is on the slides (which are on canvas) or is covered in the few chapters of reading that Prof. Gardner assigns from the textbook. Overall, I feel like I learned a ton and this is a great intro to psychology for anyone who's interested in the subject or who just needs a distro.",
                    "107": "This course with Professor Gardner was great. She was realy good at keeping the class engaged and even when the topics were a bit boring, her energy kept the room pretty alive. It's a big class, but definitely doable. Studying is definitely mandatory though. Three exams, non cumulative, and all passable as long as you study. Definitely find your study style and actually try to retain the information (for each test) though cause some questions can throw you in for a loop.",
                    "108": "Take this course with Wendi Gardner shes great,",
                    "109": "Prof Wendi Gardner is a great teacher. She makes each class interesting. She teaches with slides, and you will not receive the slides until after class, so you do not need to copy information from the slides during class. For her tests they are completely multiple choice. Make sure to study the slides and the textbook sections from the study guide. The tests included information form the most tiniest of details so even if you think that something does not seem important enough to study, there is a huge chance that it will be on the test. Study for the test ahead of time since there will be a lot to study from, so I suggest making flashcards after each class instead of waiting last minute. Overall, this class is interesting, and you will enjoy it, definitely recommend taking it with Prof Gardner, she also gives you extra credit assignments to boost your grade. Also, the exams get curved, so it benefits everyone for a couple of extra points.",
                    "110": "This is an extremely fun and informative class. The amount of material that you learn in this class, especially in a decently short amount of time, is immense, which is both a positive and a negative of the course. A huge plus of this course is Professor Gardner herself. She is incredibly engaging and knowledgeable, applying her own knowledge and examples to the lecture material that really enhanced my understanding of the material. There are so many graded assignments in this class, which I think is a major positive. It both helped keep my knowledge of the course fresh at all times, but it also puts less pressure on the students for the exams. I struggled with the exams in this class, but once you figure out how the questions are asked, it is much easier to take them. Professor Gardner is also great about helping students with the material outside of class hours, especially with office hours with herself and the TAs pre–exams. The material in this course is absolutely fascinating and is portrayed in very engaging ways, with class participation included. Overall, I enjoyed this course a lot and I think it is a great, all be it somewhat challenging, introductory course.",
                    "111": "This course is alright. It is a lot of memorizing, but you really only have to put in work and time before each midterm; there are three and each cover 5 or 6 lectures. It's an easy class in the fact that you really are only memorizing. the exams are multiple choice and non–cumulative which is nice. they feel very similar to AP psych. as long as you rewrite the lectures and put in the time to study notecards and vocab before each midterm, you're good",
                    "112": "The lectures are extremely interesting, and if you stay on top of your reading outside of class, the course becomes very very manageable, and tests accurately reflect the material. It's easy to do well if you study and do the work on time. I think I learned a lot but was also incredibly interested, and the assignments never felt over bearing because the class was very interesting and taught very well.",
                    "113": "Take this course with Prof. Gardner!!!! She's such a kind and skilled instructor. There are weekly quizzes (open book and at home), weekly discussion posts, 3 midterms, and no finals! This course covered a lot, it's not the easiest of A's but getting an A is definitely doable if you put in the work. The workload is very manageable, but the amount of knowledge you need to have going into the exams can get overwhelming.",
                    "114": "I had a very positive reaction on this course as the professor was very chill and good at teaching the material. The material itself wasn't too difficult and you get enough time to learn everything, as long as you manage your time effectively, which I personally didn't do. Overall, it was a good, and not too difficult, intro to psych course.",
                    "115": "TAKE THIS COURSE! This class was by far my favorite of the quarter. Prof Gardner is one of the best professors ever and is a phenomenal lecturer. Her slides are clean and concise and yes honestly she is amazing. The average for exam 1 was a 79 and exam 2 was I think around an 85. However, if you study everything for like a day you will be totally fine. I made like 200 flashcards on quizlet, memorized them, and got an 85 and then 97 on the first two exams. ALSO THEIR NON CUMULATIVE. The exams are very reasonable and fair and she provides many extra credit opportunities if you need. The class is so interesting and I cannot stress enough how much I loved this course.  Easy to get an A if you just study. Also don't forget to do the discussion responses bc the class is graded on a points systems so writing one response question is the same as one multiple choice question. I knew a bunch a kids who missed the deadline for hws and it's just stupid points to lose, so I would recommend doing the discussion post, response, and at–home quiz right after class. It takes like 30 minutes total and that's all the work you have each week (unless ofc there is an exam).",
                    "116": "Make sure to study for the exams. Some people underestimate how specific the test is and don't study enough. This class moves fast; if you aren't good at cramming, you must start early. However, it is not hard to do well on the exams.",
                    "117": "If you're reading this, take the course. You'll learn a ton, and it's mostly taught by incredibly engaging professors. It isn't particularly hard if you're smart about it (see below).<br><br><br>How to succeed in this course: *study smart* use the concepts of active recall and spaced repetition to learn this content WELL. use quizlet, notion, quiz yourself regularly. If you do, you'll walk out with an A and an incredible wealth of knowledge.",
                    "118": "This class is fairly straightforward. Here's the tip: use anki or another flashcard software with spaced repetition to memorize the terms in class and you'll be golden. 3 tests, all multiple choice, open note quizzes every week (not scary, don't worry), discussion posts graded on participation, and 4 extra credit essays. The class is curved only in the upward direction, and really seems to be geared towards incoming freshman as a sort of gentle introduction to college life. Don't worry about this class too much, it's not bad at all! Also, Prof. Gardner is a lovely human, so bear that in mind.",
                    "119": "Study slides well",
                    "120": "Every week, there is a discussion post and a quiz. There are extra credit assignments along the way. There is 3 exams each worth 80 Points. There are a total of 300 points. We have to do some psych lab studies around campus. As long as you study the content material on the slides and assigned reading for the exams, the exams are not too difficult.",
                    "121": "This course is not scary! Professor Gardner is SO nice and explains things really well. All you have to do is memorize all the material which really isn't that difficult if you use quizlet and then lecture the material to yourself. The exams and quizzes aren't that bad either, just study!",
                    "122": "Very engaging course with straightforward material",
                    "123": "This course was great. Wendy is amazing but goes through slides quick. We definetly made the most out of our time.",
                    "124": "Overall this course was quite interesting and well serves its purpose as an intro. The instruction was very good and engaging at most times, highly recommend taking this course with Prof. Gardner. That being said, class can feel repetitive/monotonous, where I'd find myself just sitting and taking constant notes for 60–70 mins– then with adequate flashcards it is pretty easy to succeed on the non–cumulative, multiple choice tests.",
                    "125": "I thought that this class would be an easy A class, but it is not. You have to memorize a lot of material.",
                    "126": "LOVED this class! Doctor Gardner is a super engaging lecturer and the content is really interesting. The homework is easy so really the only time you have to spend an extended amount of time on the class is before the tests. It’s a lot of memorization but each exam is non–cumulative so you only have to know 5 classes worth of information for one exam.",
                    "127": "I really enjoyed this course. Dr. Gardner is a great lecturer and was able to make long lectures really engaging. Definitley a good distro course.",
                    "128": "I have a lot to say about this course. I entered the class very interested in psychology, and knowing this course with this professor was a smash hit for many of my friends. The class is a lot. For an intro class, you must REALLY understand the material to get an A — it's definitely not an easy A. There are three exams with quite tricky questions that aren't simply definition–based. There's also a ton of material to get through, so much so that the professor doesn't have enough time to teach it all in class, so she has you read the textbook instead. That being said, the information taught is so interesting, especially for a non–psychology major. Professor Gardner is a fantastic lecturer who tries to make the material enjoyable. I can tell she is in over her head with the curriculum because she can't fit all of it into her slides.  Anyway, I would recommend it if you're taking a lighter courseload because studying for exams can take up a lot of time. I forgot to mention that there are also discussion board posts, replies, and weekly mini–quizzes that are online and untimed. Professor Gardner provides us with four extra–credit opportunities in the form of short papers. There's also a hefty lab requirement to get a grade in this class. To get an A, you can't just mess around –– this class is a lot of work, but for me, it was well worth it because the material was so interesting.",
                    "129": "I LOVED THIS CLASS! The professor was amazing at giving lectures. She knew the material well, and was very engaging and personable. I also greatly appreciated her slide shows. She always posted them after class and they were worded well so that you could easily study them. The course material is also very fun to learn. It was basically like learning a bunch of fun facts each class. There is also extremely little work outside of the class. And there are opportunities for extra credit. There are some textbook readings that you should do, but they are very manageable. There is also no cumulative final which is nice and each midterm is multiple choice. You also have to either participate in psych studies or write a paper (which is just a participation grade) in order to pass the class. I opted into doing the psych studies, and they were also very manageable to fit into my schedule. If you get the chance, TAKE THIS CLASS. And when you sign up make sure to check off that you want to be on the waitlist because this class fills up fast.",
                    "130": "Prof. Gardner is so fun and engaging! Exams involve quite a bit of memorization, but many concepts are obvious and therefore easy to remember.",
                    "131": "Wendi is amazing!!!!! 3 non–cumulative exams, with lecture slides posted. 4 extra credit opportunities. The lab requirement is a bit of a pain but that is something out of the professor's control. She is an amazing lecturer with an obvious passion for teaching and being a researcher!",
                    "132": "Super easy course if you pay attention in lecture. There is a lot of content but since the exams are multiple choice, a lot of it is just recognition and general understandings of the concepts. Super interesting content also",
                    "133": "This is a great intro class! It goes over many interesting topics at a very reasonable/manageable pace and provides information in a way that is easy to understand.",
                    "134": "The material is fairly basic however it is basically impossible to get an A unless you are really good at either psychology or test–taking. That is because  the 3 tests you take are worth 80% of your grade and there is barely any curve given. Take this course if you want a class with not a lot of homework but don't expect it to be an easy A.",
                    "135": "Great class, and Gardner is an amazing professor who really cares about the student and manages to make an 80 minute lecture engaging, informative, and humorous. Take it with her if you can!",
                    "136": "This class is very captivating. Professor Gardner is a very passionate lecturer, always presented the material in an engaging and captivating way, and answered students' questions thoughtfully and thoroughly. The class moves at a very rapid pace, and sometimes it can be difficult to keep up with notes during class time, but this is due to the sheer amount of material presented in the class and the shortness of the 10 week quarter system.",
                    "137": "This course was not an easy A, it definitely takes a lot of work to get an A. If you go to office hours and go to class and study really hard for the exams then you should be good.",
                    "138": "So much content is covered in the lectures, and basically all of it is important for the exams.",
                    "139": "Fun and interesting humanities/theme course. Covers basics of psych well.",
                    "140": "Every topic taught in this course felt relevant and new. I feel beyond satisfied and happy with the content I learned from this course.",
                    "141": "Prof Gardner is great! She is an engaging lecturer who makes sure students have their questions answered. This is a pretty standard intro to psych class; you cover a lot of topics but don't go in depth into any topic. Your grade is primarily made up of 3 exams (50 multiple choice questions). There is also a weekly discussion post (anything that stood out to you, any questions, etc) and a weekly mini Canvas quiz (5 questions, unlimited time, open note). Overall, I would recommend taking this course as it does provide a good background in psychology, is not stressful, and Prof Gardner is great!",
                    "142": "Such a great intro to psych class with a lot of interesting topics, but not super hard. If you put the time into memorizing the slides, you will do great in the class. Gardner is a wonderful prof who is so passionate about what she does.  Do all of the extra credit papers, they are easy and honestly fun to write and can be a great grade boost. Weekly quizzes and discussion posts do not take long to complete.",
                    "143": "I found this course to be very informative and gave me a lot of information that I can carry into everyday life. It's very practical as a whole.",
                    "144": "Professor Gardner is a very captivating lecturer! I got the sense that she really cares about getting to know what her students are interested in, as she would always answer my semi off topic questions after class.",
                    "145": "Professor Gardner is amazing!! The class was fascinating and had a low workload. Lectures felt like a TedTalk, which was kind of fun.",
                    "146": "Prof Gardner teaches this class very well. Easy A if you study. I learned a ton and find it super relevant to my everyday life.",
                    "147": "This course was really interesting and engaging even though it is a longer lecture style. Professor Gardner is amazing and makes you want to go to class and do well! Assessments were very fair and to do well just needed memorization of the material. Three non cumulative midterms that could be studied for only two days prior. 40% of the class is take home quizzes and discussion board so should be an easy 100%. Highly recommend!",
                    "148": "It was very interesting to get an in depth exploration of mental health and OCD",
                    "149": "Great class. Prof. Gardner is a really engaging lecturer and all the topics are pretty interesting. Just a discussion post and response a week, three non–cumulative exams that are pretty light work if you read the 5 or so sections in the textbook (not long at all) and study with like a Quizlet or something (I didn’t and I’m pretty sure I still got an A), and four opportunities throughout the quarter for extra credit. The lab requirement is also no big deal, if you stagger the studies like I did throughout the quarter like I did you’ll be golden. Overall easy and actually interesting distro/FD.",
                    "150": "Overall, this is a good course to take, whether you're interesting in psychology or just want to take a chill distro. I would say that this course isn't as easy as people make it out to be because there's still a decent amount to put in since this class is a very memorization–based class. But as long as you don't have an issue with memorizing things, I recommend this course.",
                    "151": "professor is a really good professor. She is really kind and good at presenting her information and slides.",
                    "152": "Take Psych 110 with Prof Gardener! The only out of class work is to study for 3 non–cumulative multiple choice exams and write weekly discussion posts, so this class isn't that time consuming. This class made me realize that I want to minor in psychology because I found the material a lot more interesting and applicable to real life than my other classes.",
                    "153": "Good introductory course to psychology. I had never taken a psychology course before this and now I want to continue with the subject! Professor Gardner is great and her lectures were always very engaging.",
                    "154": "grading is actually kinda tough, don't take if you want an easy A",
                    "155": "Professor Gardner is very passionate about the material, and she does a great job balancing engaging with the lecture slides and maintaining an efficient pace. The grade is comprised of 3 non–cumulative multiple choice exams (80% total), weekly open note quizzes (10–15%), and weekly discussion posts (5–10%). There are also 3–4 extra credit paper opportunities worth taking advantage of. The exams are almost entirely application–based, so it is imperative to study terms and their applications. Access to the textbook is also needed as about 10–15% of exam questions come from the textbook. This course is not an easy A, so it's not the easiest distro course, but with adequate studying it is possible to get one.",
                    "156": "I would definitely recommend this course if you are looking for a chill elective / theme requirement. The class is pretty interesting, though I felt that the first half of the class was more interesting than the second half. There were 3 non–cumulative exams, which is pretty nice, but I would highly recommend making flashcards from your lecture notes because there is a lot of information to memorize for each exam. Prof. Gardner was an engaging lecturer, and the class was finished before Thanksgiving, which was super nice.",

A very high level, yet interesting overview of the major. You are required to participate in around 6.5 hours of psychology testing to receive a letter grade. Solid intro class.",
                    "164": "I loved this course. I learned a lot. Homework is not too bad and there are multiple extra credit opportunities.  The exams can be challenging just because of the extensive amount of information they cover."

This course is very content–heavy and moves at a fast pace, but if you are able to keep up with the readings, Inquizitives, and attending each lecture, you'll be able to understand the content and do well on the 3 exams.",
                    "1": "Renee is the best! She makes class super engaging and interesting. The tests can be challenging for an intro level psych course, but as long as you do all the practice questions you will know everything you need to for the exam. 3 non–cumulative tests that are done before reading week. Highly recommend!",
                    "2": "Take Psych 110 with Renee! She's so engaging and entertaining and I was always excited to come to class every week. The exams are not bad at all and as long as you study you'll be fine. The only unit I didn't really like was the neuro unit because I'm not a fan of biology, but other than that I loved learning about concepts that can be applied to my daily life. This course is what has inspired me to do a Psych minor because I enjoyed it so much.",
                    "3": "I learned a lot about myself and the people around me",
                    "4": "This course taught me many new things and Professor Engeln made the class very engaging. The exams are a little hard but if you keep up with the material and do the review questions you should be fine. Overall great class.",
                    "5": "Renee will challenge you. You can take this course as an easy distro with other professors. But her class will teach you how to study and how to do it effectively. It's a hurdle but one that will teach you how to overcome any future hurdle.",
                    "6": "This class is awesome &amp; so much fun. Renee is the best lecturer I have ever had at NU",

                    "8": "Renee is a very passionate professor. However, I would not recommend taking this class with her unless you are SUPER interested in psychology. The exam questions are very hard and tense. On our first exam, she asked a question about an example she gave in class – this is how specific the questions are. It's definetly not an easy A class...",
                    "9": "I LOVED THIS CLASS!! All bow down to Prof. Rene Engeln!! She is one of the best professors at this university, hands down. She is witty, down–to–earth, fun, and above all – an AMAZING teacher!! It's definitely a lot of studying for the exams, I won't lie – but it's so worth it if you're genuinely interested in the subject!",
                    "10": "This course is not an extremely easy distribution requirement, yet it is still incredibly achievable given you are able to set aside the proper amount of time for it. One thing I wish I would have known going into this course is that your grade is almost entirely composed of exam scores, so if you are a bad test–taker, that is something to keep in mind for this course.",
                    "11": "It's a lot of memorization and a lot of the questions are ambiguous. If you understand the concepts well you should do fine. The concepts themselves are not very challenging.",

This class will force you to perfect your study skills. but you will also walk away with a lot more knowledge than you had before.  The class isn't easy, it ended up being one of my biggest stressors this quarter, but it was worthwhile. Don't take this class if you're looking for something easy, but if you have an interest in psychology then it's totally worth it. Also, Renee was a GREAT teacher, she made the class super engaging.",
                    "13": "I loved this course. It was the right pace and was not overwhelming. The assessments were also really fair.",
                    "14": "This course was not too bad. It's a lot of memorization but what can you expect from Intro to Psych. I recommend taking this course if you are interested in Psych or it's a great distro it's very interesting and you learn a lot.  However, Professor EngeIn's lectures are mostly just her talking rather than going thru the concepts. I wish she would go over the terms more in depth. The work is easy and self explanatory. Just have to study a lot for the midterms.",
                    "15": "Readings kind of annoying and long but just do them because they pair well with the lectures and help reinforce the learning. Tests all MCQ which is alright but gotta spread out studying because craving is too hard for this class",
                    "16": "If you put in the work for this class you will be rewarded. You just have to put in the work. Luckily professor Engeln does an amazing job at giving review materials and extra credit.",

There are three non–cumulative exams which really breaks up the content (thankfully, because there is a lot) and makes it more manageable. Lots of opportunities for in–class and extra credit which boost your grade.",
                    "21": "This course was really fun and pretty easy to do well in. It can be easy to put off, leaving you with a lot of work to catch up on, but none of it is very difficult. Definitely recommend taking at some point, even if you just want to learn some cool things.",
                    "22": "Just study the review questions, and also understand that the questions are worded a little weirdly sometimes. Really read the question, and you'll be fine!",

                    "24": "I had a relatively enjoyable time in the class. It definitely can be challenging, so pay attention to lectures from the beginning. Highly recommend.",
                    "25": "I thought Renee was a phenomenal teacher, and she was a great lecturer and made herself very accessible outside of class.  I really enjoyed the class and didn't find it to be fairly difficult",
                    "26": "I really enjoyed this class! Professor Engeln is such an engaging and fun professor, so lectures are never boring. The content itself was also more interesting than a lot of other classes I've taken. Most of your grade is determined by three exams, but they're not cumulative and they're only multiple–choice questions. The inQuizatives seemed kind of unnecessary, but it was an okay resource. There's lots of extra credit opportunities in this class, and they do make a difference in your grade, so I would definitely take advantage of them. Overall, really liked this class even though it was pretty surface level psychology.",
                    "27": "I liked that the Inquizitives were what we used to study, that made learning the class material and studying effective and engaging. Renee is great, so the lectures were usually engaging, they can feel long sometimes but it's so easy to keep up.",
                    "28": "Take this class if you want to become a better student. The first few lessons in this course are fully about how to study and get the best grades possible. There is a lot of extra credit, attendance isn't mandatory, and they pretty much tell you how to study. Just study, especially for the first test and you should get a high B or A.",
                    "29": "I really liked this class and loved Professor Engeln. Her lectures are very engaging and she is clearly passionate about teaching. Everything you need to study for the exams is in the review questions she posts. Do the review questions after each lecture (if you can) and stay up to date with readings and inquizitives! Do not leave all review Q's until right before the exam just to make it easier for yourself. I made a quizlet of all the review Q's and necessary terms and just repeated the flashcards over and over until I knew everything –– I think putting effort into your answers for the review Q's and flashcards are the best way to do well in this class. Go to office hours! She is super helpful. Definitely recommend.",
                    "30": "I LOVED this class. I would definitely recommend taking Intro to Psych with Renee. She is such a good Professor and keeps the students so interested throughout her lectures. The grading in this class is composed of three big multiple choice exams, so if you're not a good test taker, that could be a cause for concern. However, I wouldn't let that deter you from taking the class as the tests are not that bad in terms of difficulty as long as you pay attention in class and look over the review sheets posted.",
                    "31": "Psychology is such an interested subject that I recommend all Northwestern students look into. If you put in the work and are motivated to learn, a good grade is completely achievable. I can tell that Professor Engeln truly cares about her students and is interested in the topic she teaches. Would recommend to take this course.",
                    "32": "Very interesting and engaging class. You get what you put into it. If you took AP Psych in high school some of the materials might be familiar to you",
                    "33": "I loved this course! Professor Engeln is an awesome lecturer, and every class was interesting and engaging. She really made an effort to draw us into the material, and she tried to make it fun and entertaining, while also taking the content seriously and pointing out interesting details you might not have noticed at first glance. She was super clear about course expectations and told us exactly what we needed to know for our exams. The assessments and assignments were super fair, and I actually really enjoyed the readings for this course as well.",
                    "34": "The intro to psych course covers all the basics of psychology and catch us non AP Psych students up to students that already have that advantage, albeit fitting an year's worth of psyhology into a quarter.",
                    "35": "Renee is a great lecturer! Tests are on the harder side but she prepares you well for them.",
                    "36": "prof. engeln does a really great job at keeping lectures digestible, engaging, and interesting. there are three exams that consist entirely of multiple choice. exams are relatively difficult and require a lot of memorization, but if you give yourself enough time to study, you should be fine.",
                    "37": "Solid distro, with little homework, multiple choice exams which are straightforward most of the time. but you need to study quite a bit because the questions are very specific and you need to understand the material well. the reading is unnecessarily long sometimes but manageable. I would recommend the class solely because I think it changed how I think about myself in a lot of ways and was transformational in that sense. I guarantee you will also learn a bunch of things about yourself.",
                    "38": "I found this course very interesting, and the material wasn't hard to grasp.",
                    "39": "I loved this class, it was very effective in learning so much information in such a short period of time.",
                    "40": "The material is not hard and if you pace correctly is extremely doable, show up to lecture because there are in class assignments that count towards your grade. Do the extra credit because they are pretty easy points.",
                    "41": "Renee is a good professor since she always answers all your questions and tries to add relevant examples to the modern–day world. I did find it a little difficult to pay attention during the whole class period because she would sometimes talk about a subject for too long and I lost focus on what the whole point was.",
                    "42": "Very good",
                    "43": "I learned a lot of interesting information and overall enjoyed the course and instruction.",
                    "44": "Take this class with Engeln. Super fun and engaging professor, I was always interested in what was going on in the lectures. The readings could be tedious and took a fair bit of time but I did feel like i was learning interesting things from it. I loved how Engeln posted review questions for textbook readings and lecture notes to help us prepare for exams, which were not that hard if you prepared well with those review questions. Also a lot of extra credit opportunities which was awesome. Definitely recommend this class with Engeln, great option as a distribution requirement.",
                    "45": "The course is very fun and engaging without being too much work or too difficult.",
                    "46": "This class and Renee are great! A lot of people end up dropping this class because it's harder than people expect and midterm scores are a substantial component of the grade.  A lot of people are taken off guard by the level of detail on the first midterm. I think the content is not necessarily hard, but not all of it is \"common sense\" or completely intuitive. The (all multiple choice) exams are not hard but require thoughtful preparation; if you study hard you will do well. I appreciated the little extra credit opportunities. Again, Engeln is fantastic and super engaging.",
                    "47": "Prof. Engeln is a great professor, she is very entertaining and enthusiastic when lecturing and the material presented in class and the readings is what is on the exams",
                    "48": "I loved the lectures and lecturer. Straightforward exams and the professor would give us review questions that basically dictated what would be on the exam. Made me love psych even more.",
                    "49": "I liked this class — Renee made lectures engaging, and it wasn't too much work, just a lot of memorization. I don't know if I'd take it if I could go back and choose another social science distro, but it was interesting to learn the basic foundations and history of psych.",
                    "50": "Most interesting course I've taken so far. If you're considering diving into the world of psychology, this intro class with Professor Engeln is a fantastic starting point. You'll get a taste of a variety of topics, enough to know what really grabs your interest without getting bogged down in too much detail. What sets this class apart is Professor Engeln’s way of teaching – she is really passionate, she really loves what she teaches and she breaks down ideas into something you can really grasp, moving beyond just throwing definitions at you. It’s this approach that not only made the subject matter click for me but also made the class genuinely enjoyable. Plus, the exams are relatively easy (all multiple choice) compared to most intro classes, and there's not much work required outside of class. I do recommend attending the classes, though, as many exam questions come from discussions or even offhand remarks made during lectures. The only downside? You're required to participate in multiple studies, which is a mixed bag—some are fascinating, but others can be pretty tedious. Despite that, I'd definitely recommend this course to anyone looking to explore psychology in an engaging and low–pressure environment.",
                    "51": "I liked coming to this class simply because the lectures were so enjoyable and the content and work along with it was always set up perfectly to coincide.",
                    "52": "I came into this course knowing a good amount of psych but having never taken a psych class, and it definitely filled in the gaps of my knowledge.",
                    "53": "models due after exam. three exams prof give study guides.",
                    "54": "Great introductory psychology course. Definitely do the textbook readings as the exams go over things that were not necessarily discussed in class. Great prep for the psych/soc section of the MCAT",
                    "55": "This course is assessed very fairly. There are lots of opportunities to improve your grade outside of exams.",
                    "56": "This class was tough. It honestly felt like a weed–out class which is sad because it's literally psych 110. The content is mildly interesting and Renee is very energetic, but the exams were HARD. There is extra credit opportunities, but often felt like the tests were so unnecessarily hard, especially compared to other psych 110 professors. Would probably recommend taking this class with a different prof.",
                    "57": "This was a great course. The tests were difficult, but fair. The proffessor is an incredible lecturer who makes all classes incredibly interesting, which is hard to do for an hour and a hlaf long class! I look forward to taking more classes with her in the future.",
                    "58": "This course is definitely not as easy as you might think. There is a lot of reading and sometimes it gets hard to keep up with everything. A good amount of what you read will not be covered in class and will still be tested on the exam. Use flashcards, and distribute your revision as it gets harder to memorize everything last minute. I'd also highly suggest to do all the extra credits assignments; they might raise your grade. There are also in–class assignments. They are worth less than 3% but it is still a good addition to your grades; so attend lectures. There also subtle things that the professor might say in class that will appear on the exam, so focus when in class, I'd suggest putting your phone away and maybe trying to take your notes in a notebook instead of using an ipad. THIS IS NOT AN EASY DISTRO CLASS! If you are genuinely interested in psych, you will love professor Renee, but if you are just looking for a distro, this will definitely be a challenging class (I found it to be very biology oriented). There is also a lab requirement which can get stressful and very annoying ( lots of surveys to complete).",
                    "59": "Do not take this class if you don't need to. I was hoping for a chill class where I could engage with my interest in psychology. In reality, it was WAY too time–consuming for an intro class. It was far too much memorization and you kind of have to go to class...but class doesn't teach you much.",
                    "60": "It was a super fun and educational course! I love that I could apply everything I learned to daily life.",
                    "61": "This course is a bit more work than you might expect, but its really great and interesting! The textbook chapters are long and do take a while, but they help so much with the exam. If you don't cram and do all the review questions as you go, the class feels really manageable. If you stay on top of things, you can definitely get an A. Go to the lectures, Renee really keeps you engaged and some content she tests on is only covered in class.",
                    "62": "I was very happy with this course and learned way more than I ever expected.",
                    "63": "the teacher is amazing but be sure to pay attention to the examples she shows in class they might show up on the exam",
                    "64": "The class is basically no work and very manageable. I did not do too well on exams but exams are completely manageable. Honestly I think it depends on how much you are interested in the content. I was not interested very much despite having a really good teacher.",
                    "65": "This is a great foundation of psychology, super interesting, pretty straight–forward in terms of what you need to know",
                    "66": "Yes it very helpful in understanding how to relate concepts.",
                    "67": "highly recommend!",
                    "68": "Prof. Engeln is the single best professor I have ever had. I went to every lecture purely because it was always fun, and I learned a lot (very easy to get an A if you don't act like a bum). Take this class if you have any reason to even consider it!",
                    "69": "This class is very interesting. The tests are a bit difficult, and there is a ton of information but definitely a cool class. I would not say an easy A though. Renee is more of an entertainer than a lecturer.",
                    "70": "very interesting presentations to get you interested in the course.",
                    "71": "I took this class with Professor Engeln, and I loved it! Im going to be honest, this class will start off quite intimidating with the biological part and the more conceptual parts of psych, but honestly use the REVIEW questions given by her and the LECTURE questions and you will do amazing on the exams! not only that, but this is such an engaging class, every class period had something funny happen during it, making me want to keep coming to class. MAKE SURE YOU GO TO CLASS! I dont know how many times I need to extend this! there are so many in class extra credit oppurtunities so take advantage of that!",
                    "72": "Renee is a really good teacher who is very passionate about her work. The class was always very engaging and interesting. However, this is definitely not an easy A if that is your idea coming in.",
                    "73": "Take this class with Renee if you can!! She's such an entertaining lecturer and makes the class very engaging. Although classes were not recorded, it was not too hard to keep up with the pace of each lecture. A lot of the class is very memorization–heavy and requires you to memorize extremely minute details of experiments that are not very significant as well as many terms. Your grade is also nearly completely dependent on exams (86%), so it's important to properly prepare for them by going through the textbook and the notes that you take in class.",
                    "74": "The professor had an amazing attitude but the questions on her exams were worded a bit confusingly and your grade is based on 3 exams. You have to study A LOT and its a class that will require you to attend lectures every day. She does give extra credit but you have to study to do well in this class.",
                    "75": "Not an easy A but k really enjoyed the class with Renee. She’s an awesome professor the coruse is just extremely memorization heavy and the exams are a lot of the grade.",
                    "76": "The professor is one of the best I have ever taken. She is funny and keeps you engaged throughout the lecture. I liked the content of course and just do the review questions and inquizitves and you will be fine. I don't think any class should put this much weight on exams though, she does have a lot of extra credit but i think the grades should be distributed differently. I wish the lectures followed the readings more. But still great class!! Easy if you study for the exams.",
                    "77": "This class was honestly a lot easier than I expected. As long as you go to lectures and do the readings, you will have no problem on the exams. There are also plenty of extra credit opportunities to boost your grade throughout the quarter. Renee was a great professor and I was glad I took this class.",
                    "78": "Extremely well organized and interesting. I learned a lot",
                    "79": "First of all, I wanted to say that Professor Engeln is one of the most engaging professors I've had so far! I was constantly captivated by her lecture style and there was never a moment where I felt bored or uninterested. She explained concepts and ideas so well and connected them to the real world and her own life, which made them so much more authentic and understandable. I will say that you really had to study in this course to do well– there was no way around it. If you study and put in the work, you will be fine, but if you start slacking off or do the review questions at the very last minute, you will struggle. Professor Engeln always made her expectations very clear and explicit and I really liked the way she structured this course.",
                    "80": "This course is a fun, but very fast paced intro to psych. Would recommend to anyone thinking about studying psych or with a genuine interest in it. Renee is a good lecturer and very approachable.",
                    "81": "I think Psych is  very interesting and this is a pretty standard Intro to Psych course. The content is mostly learned through the textbook, so you definitely need to do the readings and it helped to have taken good notes. The tests were 80–90% content from the textbook, and the rest were random questions from lectures. Lectures mostly went over the textbook content",
                    "82": "This class is not an easy A. The exams are so hard and honestly quite unfair. The rest of the course is manageable but the exams are impossible due to questions from lecture that were mentioned for no more than 30 seconds and lectures are not recorded. Renee is a quite beloved professor but she yaps a lot and it is hard to distinguish the important material from her tangents. Think hard before taking this course.",
                    "83": "Easy exams but readings took a while",
                    "84": "The course is structured for students to succeed. Renee is a excellent, engaging lecturer and make the 80 minute class far more manageable. The readings are a bit long, but are reasonably interesting and the questions for each reading can be completed without having actually done the reading. There are review questions that you can study almost exclusively for each exams which are then extremely reasonable if have studied the questions. The exams are also all multiple choice, however they do occur every 2 weeks so it does feel like you are constantly studying and taking midterms. There are also lots of opportunities for extra credit.",
                    "85": "I really liked that this class allowed me to apply the concepts to the real world.",
                    "86": "It was definitely a good intro to psych class– it covered a big range of topics but lowkey it was kinda boring. I think the instruction was very like mid not that it was bad just that it was the same thing every class.",
                    "87": "I loved this course. Even though it was 300 people, I was super engaged and interesting in the lecture material. Prof. Engeln is a great lecturer; she is fun and nice and  also good at her job. I think this class is super manageable if you read the textbook and go to lectures. That's literally all you need to do to succeed; putting in the effort will bring you reward.",
                    "88": "Renee is awesome! Great introduction, made me interested in psych, stayed interested during the 80 minute lectures which is rare.",
                    "89": "I loved professor Englen, this was definitely one of my favorite classes I have taken, especially for a big lecture class like this. Lecture was very engaging, and I really appreciated the way she made sure we understood concepts. You do have to do the readings and go to lecture, but lecture is interesting and the review questions she gives are pretty accurate to what the exam covers.",
                    "90": "I have very mixed feelings about this course. The lecture was not really what I expected and I feel like Renee is a little disorganized. While she was always on time and what was expected of each student was clear, I didn't feel like her teaching always came across in a clear sense and I feel like she sometimes enjoyed telling stories and making jokes on stage over actually teaching. I also felt the lectures themselves weren’t the most engaging and that the slides could have been presented better visually, and like the information could have been organized more coherently with more writing/guidance on each slide. She does post chapter and lecture review questions for each lecture that are helpful in preparing for each exam, but she doesn’t post the answers so you have to go to office hours or ask a friend if there’s something you don’t know. The first two units (and subsequent tests) are honestly not very interesting and the class only really began being enjoyable during the third section. 86% of your grade is based on three multiple choice exams, which were not easy. The first two were hard and I know several people (myself included) who were struggling in the class and had done very poorly. The other part of your grade comes from inquizitives, in class extra credit, and then extra credit papers. Overall, if you are a good test taker, especially multiple choice, take this class. I didn’t do nearly as well as I would have liked to in this class and I kind of regret taking it, because I think it unnecessarily (this wasn’t for any distro or major requirement) brought down my GPA.",
                    "91": "Great class. Renee is a great professor. If you go to every class and take notes and you study her review questions before the exam, you will do well. The review questions prepare you very well for each exam.",
                    "92": "Professor Engeln was very enthusiastic and explained concepts well in psychology. The exams were manageable with sufficient studying, and it was a good distro to take.",
                    "93": "Kinda boring class, but Engeln is a great lecturer, but she only covers half of what is actually covered on the test, so half of the content is just from the textbook. The curriculum is very similar to AP Psych",
                    "94": "super interesting class!! renee is the best— lectures were so engaging and entertaining. tests are fair but it does take a lot of studying to memorize everything. however, she gave us several extra credit opportunities and the test averages were pretty good so i think it's easy to get a decent grade without stressing too much. the inquizitives are so annoying though",
                    "95": "Has quite a few moving components, from the exams, the online homework (InQuizitives, which were more frustrating than informative) and the psych study participation. I think everything is generally low intensity, but can be a reasonable amount of work as it adds up.",
                    "96": "All this considered, intro psych is very interesting, however, the tests are beyond brutal. Honestly, if you were thinking of taking this class to get a free A without putting in much effort, then think again. If I were to do the course again, I would REALLY do as the professor says and read 1 textbook chapter every week instead of cramming right before the test. So overall, a great class, but very challenging.",
                    "97": "This class is really interesting but you definitely have to work for the A. There's a lot of material to get through and the exams come very quickly (although they're not cumulative which is really nice). You need to go to class because the slides aren't usually detailed enough to supplement what you'd miss. STUDY THE WAY YOU'RE TOLD. On the first day, Renee told us that she'd post review questions for the textbook and lectures and to only focus on that content when studying. She also recommended not annotating the textbook because it's a waste of time so keep that in mind when reading.",
                    "98": "Renee is really good at giving lectures. Lectures usually feel more like a TED talk rather than a class. The grading system is also super chill, I never really felt stressed about this class. Most of the content is really interesting, so even when you do have work, it doesn't feel like a drag.",
                    "99": "i was originally really excited for this course, but after finding out that literally 3/4 of this course is just self taught i was really disappointed and became really uninterested. getting an a is definitely possible as its all multiple choice, however you need to put in adequate work into mastering the unlogical way some of the questions are asked.",
                    "100": "This class is the best!! Renee is an engaging lecturer. There is a huge range of content covered in this course, and the grade is mostly based on three non–cumulative exams. We did not get into social psychology, personality, and disorders until the end of week 7.  The exams are challenging because a broad range of information is covered, but an A/A– is very doable, especially with ample extra credit.",
                    "101": "It was so much information in such a short amount of time. It being a lecture class made it super difficult to focus and learn, especially because we didn't cover all the test material in class. Renee is great but it was really hard. The lab requirements didn't take as long as I thought they would but they were annoying.",
                    "102": "This is a very interesting course, especially if you are interested in being a psych major. I will say it's definitely not an easy A; lots of tedious readings and complex material to memorize. Be prepared to cover every aspect of psychology, including neuroscience and biology. Exams are difficult. But Renee is a great professor who is passionate about the topic and provides extra credit opportunities.",
                    "103": "I loved this course!!! Definitely take it with Prof. Engeln if you can, she is the best. Super interesting material, the tests are not cumulative, and this class was often the best part of my week especially during a tough winter quarter. Also, attend class!!!! There are a lot of extra credit opportunities during throughout the quarter, and the in–class assignments are an easy way to boost your grade.",
                    "104": "This course is fun! There is a lot of memorization but if you pace it out it is pretty manageable.",
                    "105": "Engeln was a great professor; she was blunt and straightforward but also clearly passionate about psychology. It was a very test heavy course, but if you studied and prepared sufficiently, over a decent amount of time and preparation, you would be fine. It is not a class that you can skip and do well in. It is extremely participation and attendance dependent, and if you are not at every lecture, it is often that you will miss things on the exams. However, if you attend class, do the readings, and start studying for the exam with sufficient time to prepare, you will be fine. Engeln was a great professor and she motivated her students to come to class and kept everything very entertaining and applicable to real world examples. Definitely do not think this class will be an easy A, but you will learn a lot.",
                    "106": "This class taught me a lot. Professor Renee was a great lecturer and was very helpful and answered questions really well.",
                    "107": "Take this class!! You will learn so much about yourself and the world around you and Professor Engeln does a great job of making every lecture very engaging with real–life and relatable examples. The class consists of 3 exams and  many chances for extra credit opportunities, so as long as you do homeworks you should be fine!",
                    "108": "The tests were not too bad but often Renee would pull out random information that she offhandedly mentioned in lecture which didn't seem relevant to my learning or understanding of material.",
                    "109": "Professor E is a great professor. This class is engaging and a good introductory class to psych; even though I'd never taken psych in high school, keeping up with the content was not unmanageable. Exams are difficult in that they're all application–based questions, but not incredibly awful. Do the review questions she gives! She gives out tools to try to help people succeed in this class.",
                    "110": "Pretty solid intro psych class. There was more about research methods and neuroscience than a typical course I think but it wasn't too bad. The exams are essentially your entire grade, and they are difficult, but you have lots of time to prepare and studying isn't too hard. Definitely answer the lecture and reading review questions as you go because that is great for gradually accumulating info. There are always some really difficult questions each exam and even if you study you can't guarantee an amazing score, but they aren't impossible by any means.",
                    "111": "The textbook is everything in this class. All the material for the exams is in the textbook and not everything is covered in class. However, there are also some important studies mentioned in class that are on the tests so it's important to attend class. Renee was a good teacher and clearly both knowledgeable and enthusiastic but sometimes went on tangents that made the class turn into a stand–up comedy esk routine.",
                    "112": "The class is super interesting. The tests are very hard. The best way to do well in this class is to learn the test, learn how to identify the concepts within a multiple choice test. Also, do the EC papers, they are easy and kind of fun. They also help you study.",
                    "113": "it was very insightful",
                    "114": "Good course, mistake was not studying early, review before and after class and make sure to take notes during lectures because some specific things talked about in class pop up on the exams",
                    "115": "It was an okay class. Not an easy A. You definitely need to understand the processes. Although the class is not recorded and she suggests you to go to class if you learn best from a textbook you will learn more on that than the lectures. The lectures were just an add on.  Id recommend the class but you do need to put effort in.",
                    "116": "Take this course with professor Renee, she's probably the best lecturer I've had here in my time at Northwestern. Super funny lectures, loves seeing her students succeed, very warm and friendly. As for the course, content gets more interesting once you're past the biological component (structure of the eye, etc). DO NOT take this course if you're expecting a free A, you still have to put in time and effort to study for exams, but professor renee gives a lot of extra credit support to help you achieve the grade you want.",
                    "117": "Englee is a great lecturer. Studying for exam is easy as long as you take the time to review the questions. Honestly, it feels like more could be talked about in lecture and less focus could have been put on the book because the chapters are long.",
                    "118": "This class was a great intro to psychology, which did a good job of broadly covering as much of the basics as possible in a quarter class. While tests weren't easy, there were plenty of extra credit opportunities that I appreciated and the homework was a great study tool in and of itself. By going to every lecture and engaging yourself by diligently taking notes, you learn a lot in this class",
                    "119": "It was a great course overall! Highly recommend.",
                    "120": "Take this course with Renee!! Super engaging lectures and very well–taught. Not an \"easy\" A but an achievable A –– you can always be fully prepared for an exam if you use the review questions she gives. Her class is a little more biology/anatomy focused, but overall a great course to take whether or not you are interested in Psych.",
                    "121": "Professor Engeln is really passionate at teaching Psychology and she tries to make the class engaging for every student. However, the class has a larger workload than I imagined with the 2 chapters of reading per week and the 12 mandatory psych labs. It also involves a large amount of memorization for every test.",
                    "122": "very interesting topics",
                    "123": "We didn't learn much about personalities and clinical psychology, but I loved the teaching style.",
                    "124": "Fair course. As long as you do the lecture questions/textbook questions that Renee posts you'll be fine for the tests.",
                    "125": "This was an excellent intro to psych course. Professor Engeln was engaging and upbeat and managed to make each class interesting. Your grade in the class is pretty test–centered, but going to class, keeping up with the reading, and completing the review questions almost guarantees a good grade. The lab–participation component is honestly a fun way to get a little more engaged in the course work, just don't push them off till the end of the quarter.",
                    "126": "I took this class as a theme requirement and it felt a lot like high school classes. Renee is an amazing lecturer and provides so many materials to help students. 3 non cumulative exams were mainly just memorization",
                    "127": "I thought that the instruction was okay. Renee is a very engaging and clearly very intelligent professor, but I find that she leaves a lot of the complicated concepts to the homework/reading and explains the more intuitive stuff in class.",
                    "128": "RENEE ENGELN IS MOTHER. TAKE THIS CLASS WITH PROF ENGELN. she is so enthusiastic about what she teaches and such an engaging, fantastic lecturer. 80 minute classes can feel long but she does a great job of keeping it fun and interesting the whole time. if you enjoy her teaching, you can also go to her office hours to chat with her, ask questions, and hear about topics from students in other psych classes too, which was cool. the class itself is pretty packed with information and the readings can be a little overwhelming, but if you do all the assigned work and go to lecture you should learn a lot and perform well on exams (I am an engineering student and it was totally manageable alongside my other stem classes). the review questions are the most important study material, they tell you exactly what you need to know for the (3, non–cumulative) exams. this was my first psych class ever and I learned so much interesting content, since it provides an intro to many many different areas of psychological study. I'll definitely be taking another psych class with renee in the future, this was a fantastic experience and I highly recommend if you have any interest in psych or people at all.",
                    "129": "professor Engeln was amazing, the course was not difficult if you read the textbook and took notes during class and did the inquizatives. the exams were fair and she is such an engaging professor. you will me laughing most of the classes! easy A if you put in the work and are good at memorizing alot of information",
                    "130": "Professor Engeln was genuinely the best professor I have had at NU, and one of my favorite teachers of all time. Not only is she passionate about the material and a clear instructor, but she is one of the most genuine and nice people you will ever meet. She is always excited to talk in her office hours about any topic, and makes students feel very comfortable both in and out of class. For a huge introductory course, she really made an effort to get to know people in the class, and engage with individuals. The tests were very well designed to test our knowledge, and did not look to trick you... she even made a conscious effort to remove questions that tripped people up, taking the responsibiliy herself for those questions being poorly designed, and not blaming students for being incompetent. I highly recommend this course to anyone looking for a distro or anyone remotely interested in psychology if Professor Engeln is teaching it, you will love it!",
                    "131": "I LOVED this class. Renee is an amazing professor, and every lecture was so interesting and fun. If you get the chance, go to her office hours and ask her about her research––It's so cool. You can tell she really cares about her students, beyond just the realm of academic success. I learned a bunch of different things in this class about myself and the world around me that I've already put into practice. It's important to study for the tests, but this is pretty straightforward if you do the review questions Renee provides as they come out.",
                    "132": "Professor was okay. Great speaker, but I am not sure of her instruction. She read off of slides and never recorded her lectures. You had to be in lecture to get all the information because the slides literally had like a word. There were also random assignments spread throughout the quarter that could only completed in class. Exams are okay, just long and weirdly worded. Inquisitives, the homework, are kinda dumb. Not bad course, just meh",
                    "133": "Midterms were surprisingly challenging because although the questions were all multiple choice, they require you to apply everything you learned into difficult scenario questions, sometimes focusing on content that was only briefly discussed in a lecture and nowhere else. Otherwise, the lectures and content was very interesting",
                    "134": "The material is interesting, but the class requires studying.",
                    "135": "This class is great! Renee is super interesting and the lectures are involved without being too much work out of class.",
                    "136": "Renee is an INCREDIBLE professor, and she is very accessible and easy to come to when you need to discuss something with her. All else aside, this class is a lot of content and really requires you to pay attention in class and do the textbook readings for the exams. GO TO CLASS!!! She discusses things in lecture that aren't covered in the textbook but ARE covered on the exam. Take detailed notes and make quizlets and you will be fine.",
                    "137": "This course was very interesting, but it was often hard to stay on top of the work. She didn't check that you read the readings and didn't really reference any of the reading material in class, so it was easy to get behind. The tests were also very difficult and required a lot of memorization, but luckily the material was all very interesting so studying wasn't too bad.",
                    "138": "This has easily been my favorite course I've taken at Northwestern so far. Professor Renee was such an engaging lecturer and made it exciting to come to every class. There was so much material covered, but it wasn't to difficult to pick it up by staying on top of the Inquizitives and looking at the questions posted for the textbook and lectures. I feel like I learned so much, and I'm have more of a passion for psychology than when I started this class. The tests weren't too hard, especially because you're told the exact topics you need to be familiar with, and they're all multiple choice with few tricky questions as long as you feel comfortable with the content. If you don't wait until the last minute to do the review questions or Inquizitives, and you really pay attention in class, the workload for this is extremely manageable and really only took an hour or two outside of class each week. I'd highly recommend anyone who might be interested in psychology to take this course.",
                    "139": "I think this is a great course as an introduction to the topic of psychology. The homework assignments were easy and actually helped with learning the material. The exams are not too hard as long as you take good notes and study for a few hours.",
                    "140": "I learned a lot about how the brain works  and how we interact. Great course.",
                    "141": "TAKE THIS WITH RENEE. She is extremely knowledgable about the subject and an incredibly entertaining and smart lecturer. Loved going to her class. Exams are not easy, follow her tips on how to study: do the review questions, do the inquizzitives and reading for the week DURING THE WEEK, and dont leave studying until the last moment. I learned a lot and I believe everyone should take this class regardless of their major.",
                    "142": "The professor is very engaging in lectures and is highly encourages participation.",
                    "143": "This course was fantastic. It teaches basic psychological concepts that every person should know and the teacher was a phenomenal lecturer.",
                    "144": "This was a really fun and informative class. Renee is such a fun and passionate lecturer and she made me want to learn. There are 3 non–cumulative tests and you are given review questions detailing exactly what you need to study for and what will be on the test. Overall, this was just a very enjoyable class.",
                    "145": "I think I only started getting really interested in this class towards the end of the class. I really enjoyed learning about personality psych, but getting through the more structural/technical parts of Intro Psych was difficult and felt harder to grasp.",
                    "146": "Intro to Psych is a good intro class but it has a lot of readings you need to do",
                    "147": "I thought this class would be a relatively easy one, but I was wrong. The amount of reading that the professor assigns is a ton ––&nbsp;I found this being my most time–consuming course. Lectures are fun and course material is engaging, but the reading is just overpowering. Something like 500 pages.",
                    "148": "I really liked this course!! Professor Engeln has super interesting and funny lectures. There are many opportunities for extra credit both inside and outside class. The concepts aren't too difficult, but there are a lot of them. That being said, exams are fairly easy if you study (quizlet!!), especially since she gives a list of review questions with the topics that will be on the exam. The class is super interesting, and if you pace yourself well, it is pretty easy.",
                    "149": "Renee is an incredible professor and such an engaging lecturer.  The content was interesting and I enjoyed learning more about psychology. I will say, that between the lab participation requirement and preparing for the midterms –– the course could be fairly time–consuming and the exams were hyper–specific. You have to set aside time to really study and make sure you know exactly what's going on (and some of the book information isn't covered in class). I'd still recommend the course though if you're genuinely interested in psychology.",
                    "150": "This course was very interesting, I always loved psychology and the professor made it even more appealing. There was a lot of content, I felt that it was way too much for an intro course because the exams covered so much content and it felt too fast paced. The content itself way very clear and straightforward, it was difficult to study for all the content.",
                    "151": "This is probably one of the best classes I've taken at NU so far. I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, the tests are hard, assignments are long. But wow. Renee is such an amazing lecturer, and although it was an hour twenty minute lecture, I always found it extremely engaging and rewarding. The concepts are really interesting, and she just has such a compelling way of lecturing.",
                    "152": "The professor is a sweetheart but the class structure makes it hard to learn and/or care. Didn't find myself enamoured with any of the subject matter whatsoever.",
                    "153": "Great teacher",
                    "154": "I thought that the course did a good job as an introductory course, but there were definitely a few instances where we as students would question whether we were even learning psychology or anatomy.",
                    "155": "The professor was good at stirring interest in students. The material was conveyed well,  and the class was interactive when it needed to be.",
                    "156": "The classes were generally engaging, and the fact that the professor always tried to bring the topics to our reality made it easier to memorize and understand concepts. Psych is a vast field, so it can be a lot of information to take, especially when it gets closer to exams, but if you have good study strategies, you will be fine!",
                    "157": "I loved its neuroscince aspect",
                    "158": "This is a great intro course to take. It's low stakes, hardly any homework, and pretty interesting. The tests were kinda hard but as long as you give yourself ample time to prepare, you'll do great.",
                    "159": "Renee was the best professor I've ever had. She always made me laugh during her lectures and gave multiple opportunities for extra credit. The course was so interesting and also a lot of fun.",
                    "160": "I loved this class! Renee was such an amazing professor, she is super engaging and I was never bored during her lectures—I loved coming to class every time! It's also pretty easy to do well in this class because Renee offers lots of extra credit opportunities, and the exams were always very straightforward. The exams require memorizing a lot of information which was sometimes tedious, but once you do the exams are pretty easy.  I found the content we covered to be super interesting. This was my first time taking a psych class and it definitely made me want to take more. I HIGHLY recommend taking this class with Renee!"

                    "0": "Attendance is basically mandatory because lectures aren't recorded and the slides that are posted are not that valuable.",
                    "1": "This is an extremely well–taught course. Lectures were engaging with various participatory opportunities throughout the quarter. Many chances for extra credit, doable midterms if you just pay attention in Lecture or read the textbook. Lowest exam score is dropped. Easy class and an exceptional professor.",
                    "2": "I had never taken a psychology course before, and I very much enjoyed this course. I learned a lot and found the last part about psychopathology the most interesting. Some questions on the tests were a bit tricky, but most were just based on memorization.",
                    "3": "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone. It was a lot of material to memorize but the practice quizzes and inquizzative homework was honestly super helpful. I did get a little nervous about the lab portion, but it was also pretty quick and simple most of the time. Take this class for a distro!!",
                    "4": "I felt like what we as students needed to do in order to succeed was made very clear, and so the ball was in our court, so to speak. Lectures were interesting, and participating in labs was very cool. I had a great time in this course.",
                    "5": "The textbook is extremely helpful. Also appreciated the attendance extra credit. The lectures themselves were often hard to pay attention to but the textbook makes up for any information you missed. The professor is very reasonable with assignments and due dates",
                    "6": "This course was awesome in terms of applicable topics to the real world and the instruction is also very down to Earth and pragmatic.",
                    "7": "Read the textbook.",
                    "8": "I overall liked this course. The MC tests can be tricky but if you study one can do well.",
                    "9": "Fairly good class with many resources to help you practice the content. Practice quizzes were useful and very similar to the exam style questions, preparing us well for the exams. Pretty interesting, not very difficult.",
                    "10": "I think this course has a good balance of different aspects psychology. I didn't think I'd be as interested in the biological part but I found myself being better at that part than others. The course includes personality, social, biological, and medical parts of psychology.",
                    "11": "This course is not just a class where the teacher sits and lectures at you, there are many demonstrations that are fun and interactive quizzes and videos that keep the class fresh.",
                    "12": "I personally loved this course. It’s such an important course to take to begin to understand yourself and others. Although it can be challenging with a lot of info, you learn a lot and much of it is useful for your life/well–being. Professor Broaders truly cares about your learning and entertains questions deeply!",
                    "13": "Very good intro to Psych class, Professor is well prepared and gives good lectures.",
                    "14": "This course was mostly fact recall focusing on naming concepts and who created them. I would say it was an interesting intro to psych and covered at the surface a lot of different concepts. We had three midterms and an optional cumulative final which can only improve your grade. The homework is reading the textbook and doing online questions about it as well as canvas quizzes for each module. The homework is really helpful for studying for the exams.",
                    "15": "This class is not difficult, but its a ton of memorization. If you read the textbook you'll be fine.",
                    "16": "I really enjoyed taking this course. If you put in the work and do the Canvas practice quizzes, readings and the inquitives, you should succeed in this course.",
                    "17": "I thought this course was insanely tedious. Everything on the exams was based pretty much only on the textbook, which is insanely dull, but lectures are still pretty much required due to the extra credit. If you're not good learning based off reading, do not take this course.  All we learned was jargon for psychological phenomenons that a 1st grader could identify, and complicated neuroscience to go with it. Homework was just busy work, but at least it was basically a completion grade. If your taking this for a social studies distro/foundational discipline, there are definitely better options. Honestly, this course made me doubt all of psychology as a valid field.",
                    "18": "One of the biggest surprises in any class I’ve taken here. Lectures were engaging, and I feel like I came away with a deep understanding of the material.",
                    "19": "Broaders expects us to remember everything from lectures and from the textbooks and videos, but with the amount of information that is given to us, it is almost impossible to remember everything. For an intro class, there is a lot of work put in, with the inquizitives and the quizzes for every module.",
                    "20": "Doable course but definitely can make you struggle if you don't start studying in advance",
                    "21": "this class is easy as long as you put in the effort to do the readings and the practice quizzes",
                    "22": "boring but fine. memorize everything for the exams. go to class. i don't like sara broaders.",
                    "23": "Super interesting class and broaders is a great prof. She makes going to class interesting. Lots of reading and not an easy A, you need to put in a lot of time studying to get an A.",
                    "24": "I think the course covered a lot of topics and there was a lot of readings that we had to do. However, overall I liked this course.",
                    "25": "Lectures aren’t recorded which sucks because there is so much material each class",
                    "26": "It's not an easy class, but it's definitely doable. You can get an A if you stay on top of the work (there are a lot of notes), and know the material thoroughly. It's a lot easier if you've taken psych before.",
                    "27": "Good overall class",
                    "28": "This class was an easy A, but definitely more work than I anticipated. There is a lot of work outside of class: practice quizzes, readings (often times one 15–25 part chapter in one night), and interactive homework. The practice quizzes are great study tools (like 1/4 of exam questions are direct copies)  and I would recommend doing them as many times as possible before exam days. The readings are necessary if you want to do well on exams, a lot of the exam questions are only covered in readings and not in lecture. The interactive homework are actually pretty fun. The lectures are long, but pretty interesting and the final is optional which is nice since the midterms aren't super hard as long as you study. Just memorize the key concepts and pay attention in class and you will be fine",
                    "29": "I think Professor Broaders is an engaging lecturer and it was very interesting to talk to her throughout the quarter in her tea and treats office hours (highly recommend going). However, I do think that the amount of reading she has you do is a really big time commitment, and I don't think her inquisitives really helped me learn as much as her lectures or the practice exams. Do the canvas practice exams because many questions are the same as the exams",
                    "30": "Very important to keep up with the readings. Readings don't take too long, and the readings go along well with the lectures.  Midterms aren't too bad, as long as you do all the practice quizzes.",
                    "31": "Can be tackled easily through brute–force memorization, although I would not recommend doing so for learning. Very accessible instructional staff and a very fair and clear grading policy. Not the easiest distro but it's up there.",
                    "32": "The course material and expectation was reasonable. There was adequate extra credit too and reading the book and looking at the slides and using the practice quizzes posted was good enough to make you do well in the class. My main problem was that the class and professor is a bit stingy, and the grade cutoff for an A is a 94. They also refused to round anything, even though I had a 93.91, which I thought was unreasonable with the cutoff being so high.",
                    "33": "Pretty straightfoorward class. DO ATTEND CLASS. There's extra credit and it can help a lot cuz lowkey the averages for those exams kinda low for Psych 110. I would definetely recommend doing lots of inquizitive and practice quizzes for the exams",
                    "34": "Prof Broaders is a good prof but definitely gives a lot of material and even gives required external lectures that take quite a bit of time outside class. For an intro psych course this seemed like a lot of work and material and when I compared it to other profs who taught the same class my peers said Prof Broaders definitely was a tougher professor.",
                    "35": "The class had lots of material to memorize, but learned a lot.",
                    "36": "The course was exactly as I expected, very similar to AP psychology. I felt the material itself was not challenging, however the amount of material there was to learn and memorize made the class a little more challenging",
                    "37": "Prof Broaders is an engaging and confident speaker. I enjoyed her lectures. They never felt too long or overwhelming, partly because she'll include silly polls or small interactive lessons throughout her lectures. You will receive a broad understanding of the discipline. I wasn't expecting to learn so much about biology and the mechanisms that go on in the brain and the body that create our mental experiences. It was super interesting. Studying isn't difficult as long as you stay on top of assignments and do the practice quizzes a couple days in advance of the midterm.",
                    "38": "This class is a pretty standard intro class. The information isn't too hard, and Broaders makes lecture as interesting as it can be. There are 3 midterms with an optional final, and as long as you study and do a lot of memorization the exams aren't that bad. A lot of the questions come from her practice quizzes, so if you do those a lot you'll be good. Pretty boring at times, but important psych knowledge nonetheless.",
                    "39": "I absolutely loved this class. Professor Broaders is so knowledgable and wants all of her students to get good grades in the class. This class encouraged the use of notebooks, and all of the people using computers had to sit in a certain portion of the room. This really helped me focus and from now on I will only be using notebooks to take notes. Highly recommend this class.",
                    "40": "Overall, Miss Broaders demonstrated a thorough understanding of the material and engaged actively with the students. Nonetheless, there's a concern regarding the number of lab credits assigned, as 14 credits is simply TOO MUCH. Many students, myself included, faced challenges managing our schedules due to overlapping time slots with other classes. Unless you are willing to write a 15 page paper, its obligatory for you to attend these labs. Given that this is an introductory level course, she needs to lower down the credits or else she will make students ran away from becoming psych majors.",
                    "41": "This class takes a lot of time and studying outside of class but the content is super interesting. The study materials make it super easy to do well on the tests and she offers extra credit to boost your grade. Loved this class",
                    "42": "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IN THE SPRING. Prof Broaders is easily one of the worst teachers at this school. She is trying to cover too much content. The long textbook readings assigned for homework cross over with about 20% of what is covered in class. In class, she covers different stuff that is not present in the textbook. Additionally, you have no idea what in the textbook is going to be tested on, so you end up having to study a mass amount of information, from which only a portion is tested on. I still ended up with an A, but it is so much more difficult than other quarters, and honestly, I think Broaders should not be teaching this course, or at least change it to make more sense.",
                    "43": "Too hard as an introductory level course… the lectures are interesting, but you need to self study everything for the exam",
                    "44": "This class has a LOT of material to memorize. The practice tests and Inquizitives are very helpful for studying. There are three midterms throughout the quarter and if you do well enough you do not need to take the final which was very convenient. I enjoyed this class and the material, it was mostly just memorization.",
                    "45": "Psych 110 with Prof Broaders is a great class. The exams require studying material a few times and the readings can be long, but they're interesting and totally doable. Not the easiest of distros but definitely interesting and easier if you've taken AP Psych",
                    "46": "It was a very fun course. Most of the time, I looked forward to coming to class to learn whatever was next on the syllabus. I think that Professor Broaders was very engaging as a lecturer and her class demonstrations were very good. I do think that the Inquizzitives can get a little bit time consuming and the questions they ask are very specific to the textbook. But don't worry because the midterms primarily cover content covered in lecture. This class definitely sparked more curiosity in me within the field of psychology and would definitely recommend if you are exploring!",
                    "47": "This course was a good introduction to the world of psychology. Professor Broaders uses a variety of examples and media to explain topics and help students understand concepts. Overall, a very good course.",
                    "48": "Great lecturing with practice tests that really helped me understand the content.",
                    "49": "This course was very well structured for an intro course with homework readings and unlimited attempts homework quizzes, as well as content filled lectures. It was definitely challenging with so much to memorize and learn, but if you came to class and stayed caught up on homeworks then it was easy to get done. Lecture slides were also posted which was great to review notes if needed.",
                    "50": "Tests weren't too bad and felt like a lot of rote memorization/recall, I think if you do the readings and attend lectures you will be good; the lectures were sometimes not that engaging but the professor still covered a lot – the in class demonstrations were definitely interesting; the lab component could get boring and tedious at times but it was also good to see how psychology functions in a research context",
                    "51": "The hardest part of this course is memorizing everything.  There is a lot to know and you have to memorize it all for the tests.",
                    "52": "Awesome class. Finally a class where if you study and pay attention, you're guaranteed to do well on the exams. Super easy exams, extra credit, great prof. Excited to take more of her classes next year.",
                    "53": "The course was very manageable. I think the lectures covered a lot and the tests were fair. I appreciated the practice quizzes."

However, while the content should have been straightforward, the lectures are incredibly dull and many of the modules could have been taught more quickly and in a clearer manner. I learned this content in high school and found myself very confused at various points in the course. The teams for homework are very helpful to complete homework and team exercises which make up most of the overall grade.",
                    "2": "I enjoyed this class and the professor is so funny and a great statistics professor. You don’t need prior knowledge of the subject to do well. Take this class. I can't reiterate how much I appreciated Professor Bailey.",
                    "3": "Read the modules!!!! Great resource to study with. I did not enjoy going to class sesssions (so I didn't) but was able to keep up just by reading and studying the module information.",
                    "4": "The course was fine. Group work is very important to make sure you have a good relationship with your team members. Communication is very important.",
                    "5": "This course was pretty difficult for me. The material was challenging to understand and the homework and team assignments were hard. I did like that there was an opportunity to collaborate with others through team assignments and the professor was helpful in answer questions after class. This class also has a final.",
                    "6": "Professor Bailey is a fun teacher and I definitely recommend taking this course if it satisfies a major/minor or distribution requirement. I had previously taken stats before but still found that I learned a lot from this class.",
                    "7": "This class was pretty straightforward. There was a team and hw assignment every week, two midterms, and two discussion posts. The modules the prof posted were very helpful and I read those to do the weekly hws and study for the midterms and finals.",
                    "8": "This is fairly easy, there isn't a lot of work and the material isn't hard to understand if you're staying on top of it. It's not interesting and it's kind of annoying but it's an easy distro, but you might not get an A.",
                    "9": "I found this class extremely easy and fair. I barely went to lecture and passed with an A. You cover chi–square, t–tests, z–test, and some other stuff and it is not difficult at all. You have a team assignment and a solo assignment due each week. Both are easy if you understand info whatsoever.",
                    "10": "Think this professor is the best one to take the course with. Stats will never be my favorite thing in the world, but as a minor requirement the class was better than i expected.",
                    "11": "This course is not difficult to take. The professor talks quite slowly, but his instructions are clear and easy to understand. However, its more about how to use 'jmp' rather than statistics in general. We do learn theories behind the statistics, but the course more on learning to use jmp. If you are not very good at calculations, this course may not be too difficult for you.",
                    "12": "Professor Bailey is great– he makes the class entertaining and more bearable!",
                    "13": "This class wasn't bad at all! I took it as a pre–req and a distro, and it wasn't too hard overall. It was mainly notes each week, a short team assignment, and the homework (which was the same kinds of questions as the team assignment). This is a great formal studies distro for people (like me) who aren't very mathematically inclined.",
                    "14": "Please make sure to study for the midterm and for the final and don’t just say “ oh the course is easy so I won’t study.” Overall, the course is relatively easy paced. You have 1 weekly team assignment( where you do a homework worksheet as a group) and 1 weekly homework assignment. There are 2 discussions as well. The first one is at the start of the course and the second one is at the end.",
                    "15": "This course wasn't supposed to be too challenging but I found it to be hard to understand at times. The midterm did not reflect the material too well in terms of the wording of questions. Not as easy of a distro as I thought.",
                    "16": "This class made stats feel very accessible. I am a huge fan of the teaching method; every concept was explained very thoroughly!",
                    "17": "If you need a math distro you should definitely take this class. There's weekly homework assignments but they take about 5–15 minutes per assignment. Lectures were kind of dull because of the content, but Professor Bailey made it more interesting. I didn't take AP Stats or any statistics class in high school but I still found the content extremely extremely easy.",
                    "18": "This class is well–structured and not too challenging. There is only one online midterm and the final is online as well. Homework assignments are not difficult at all as long as you attend class or read the content pages. Would definitely recommend this class for those who are intimidated by stats or need a formal studies distro.",
                    "19": "Decent class, I would suggest looking up the professor on Google before you take the course, that was an interesting read. Overall, it was not too hard, It had some out–of–class work but nothing too tough. It's probably one of the easier stats courses to take here.  The midterm and final were both pretty fair and studying was straightforward going over the modules which have all the information you might need. He also gives a practice exam to help prepare you and those are very accurate to the actual exam.",
                    "20": "Professor Bailey is great. Make sure to communicate with your team members as that is very important for your success in the class. Know how to use JMP.",
                    "21": "The course itself was alright. If you've taken AP Stats the content should be rather easy. However, I was not too fond of Professor Bailey's teaching style as the pacing of his lectures was unnecessarily slow and tedious. He also talks very slowly and kind of repeats himself.",
                    "22": "This class was fairly straightforward, and as long as you looked over the Module notes and asked questions, it is not difficult to get good grades on the homework assignments. Professor Bailey was very willing to answer any questions you had, and made sure you would fully understand a concept before you had to submit any assignments.",
                    "23": "This class is very straightforward and honestly pretty simple. The team and individual homework are the main part of your grade, aside from the midterm and final obviously. As long as you go to class and pay even the smallest bit of attention, you should do more than fine on the assignments. The team homeworks are always due the Saturday before the individual homeworks are do, and most times the questions are the exact same, just different data. If you are taking this for psych major, I would recommend to just take it to get out of the way because it honestly isn't that bad.",
                    "24": "This is an ok class. Everything you need to know are on the module overviews. I found the overviews way clearer than the lectures and there were also some things covered in the overviews that were not covered during lecture. Although I liked how the professor tried to engage with the class, sometimes this would ultimately make class longer than it should. The professor something lost his train of thought which made some explanations a little confusing. I think I learned more about how to use JMP than how to do stats.",
                    "25": "This class definitely did its job. I took it for an IMC/Business Institutions requirement not really expecting much, but I feel like by the end of it, I gained a lot of knowledge on statistics I didn't have previously. I also think it's very geared towards people who don't like math or don't necessarily take advanced math courses in college, so that helped a lot in terms of the pace we were going at! The class consisted of a midterm and a final, both of which are take home (with Lockdown Browser), which I really loved. They were not that difficult and there were no big surprises with the tests –– the professor makes it clear what he is going to test on. We also had homework due every week based on each module and a team exercise with similar questions (that you are supposed to do with your assigned team). I liked this structure because it gave us a lot of practice on the content before the midterm and final, that way we were well–versed in the topic before taking the exams. So my biggest recommendation is to do the homework yourself and also to go to lectures, because then you don't actually have to review that much outside of class. This class is very manageable if you put effort.",
                    "26": "This class was fairly easy to follow and wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be.",
                    "27": "This is a great class if you need the requirement – I took stats in high school so a lot of it was very familiar (think mean, median, mode) but we also used actual stat software which was really interesting. The midterm and final were really easy, and I’m a journalism major who doesn’t do math so that’s saying something. Not much psychology involved, so anticipate your average stat class but it’s super manageable",
                    "28": "This is definitely one of the classes you just have to get through, especially if you’re a psych major/minor.",
                    "29": "Class is pretty straight forward. You need to go to class to do well.",
                    "30": "This course is not that hard as long as you read through the materials on Canvas. Bailey makes different modules that are very helpful and very clearly lay out everything you need to know. The lectures are not worth going to, as he tends to drone on and all of the information you need is in the modules.",
                    "31": "This class is not an easy A. You are paired with groups to complete homework assignments and then have individual homework assignments. However, I feel like the class lectures did not help a lot for the homework and the exams.",
                    "32": "Take it with this professor!!",
                    "33": "The lectures can be hard to be engaged with at times, but the instructor's pretty humorous, which makes it a little easier. The class has a light workload –– for each weekly module, you have a team assignment, in which you work with assigned teammates on, and an individual homework assignment. If you do the readings, which don't take that long at all, they should be easy to do –– they provide adequate detail and steps for the assignments. The exams weren't hard –– if you've done the readings and utilize the practice exams, you should be good.",
                    "34": "I really enjoyed this class. I came in with no stats experience, so I was unsure of what to expect, but I feel that this class was taught really well. There are weekly team exercises and homework assignments for each module, and it's important to try to do well on them as they are worth a large part of your grade; working with your team can be very helpful. Going through all of the notes and resources for each module was extremely helpful in reviewing for the midterm and final exams. The midterm is closed note, and I thought it was very fair. The final is made up of a closed note portion and an open note portion. The final was slightly more difficult than I expected, but I still felt that it was fair overall. Professor Bailey is pretty funny and definitely tries to make the course engaging.",
                    "35": "Sometimes the class is a little slow, but it is very easy to understand the material. It is also super easy to catch up if you miss a class or feel behind. The team exercises are nice because you can work with others and get some help, but they can be very hard to schedule if everyone is busy. I would recommend this class as an easy A and  a break from stressful classes.",
                    "36": "Prof. is awesome. Very good teaching, although a little boring at times (repetitive, that is). The class is setup so you have one HW assignment that's very similar to the group project, every single week. Read the pages and you're fine. A good class, not too difficult if you pay attention.",
                    "37": "Not a remarkable course in any sense. We spent most of our time in lecture learning various statistical tests and how to conduct them in the JMP program, but did not go into any detail as to why these are important in psychology.",
                    "38": "I liked this course. It did not take a lot of time and majority of the assignments were done in assigned groups which was really nice. Just make sure to actually study for the midterm and final since it can be tricky.. This class can be an easy A if you do well on the exams. Not a hard class.",
                    "39": "This class is good to take for a stats requirement. Not that interesting but covers the basics and not too much work. The exams aren't bad.",
                    "40": "Not too time consuming of a course. Expect to have a homework and group work assignment each week. Exams weren't bad. Course material is a little dry but Prof. Bailey tries to make it more interesting.",
                    "41": "The course was pretty boring, but  I wouldn't say it was hard.  I didn't think the professor effectively communicated course material during lecture.",
                    "42": "While I did like this class, I thought it could have more content to learn and more psychology in it (even though I know that might not be in the curricula).",
                    "43": "This class was recommended to me as an easy distribution requirement that didn't involve much math or calculations. This was true, but the lectures, often ending 20–30 mins early, didn't cover all of the topics necessary for the weekly homework, weekly teamwork, or even the midterm. Despite this, it wasn't stressed how necessary it was to follow the modules provided outside of the lecture. These modules provided in–depth, step–by–step guides to what was touched on in the lecture and were often more helpful than attending and taking notes on every lecture. The lack of feedback from TAs on weekly assignments was frustrating as well, and didn't provide any idea as to which questions were consistently wrong on the homework. The team exercises, although a good idea in theory, required too much planning to find a time that worked for everyone over the weekend, and teammates didn't exhibit much willingness to meet. The professor, hilarious at moments, was somewhat engaging though he almost assumed how much the class already knew about statistics and didn't explain new concepts in–depth.",
                    "44": "The lectures will feel long and boring at times, especially when Professor Bailey goes through history that is unrelated to the actual material we need to know for the class and exams, but it is overall very manageable . There is a weekly assignment, a team assignment (Both are very similar, I recommend doing the team one before the individual one so you can work it out with others first), two discussion posts, one midterm, and one final. The midterm was harder than the final. This class is required for the psychology major at some point, but taking it with Professor Bailey is just 'okay'.",
                    "45": "This class was not bad but I would recommend taking it with friends. You need to communicate with group members and it is hard when they don't contribute.",
                    "46": "I really appreciated the abundant amount of resources. When I was confused I would frequently reference the modules posted on canvas.",
                    "47": "Professor Bailey was really good instructor. He was always available to zoom about any questions I had with the homework or with JMP. Although, I didn't find myself having many questions because he broke down and explained each of the methods and how to test them using JMP in his lecture slides. On top of that, he would post additional websites that can help us better understand some of the concepts he discussed. There are many ways to bring up your grade with weekly homework assignments, team assignments, discussion questions, and extra credit.",
                    "48": "Math isn't my best subject, but Professor Bailey taught this course in a way that was engaging and easy to understand.",
                    "49": "The subject material for the course is decently interesting, the only thing is most of the 80 minute classes could easily be taught in half an hour. There were a handful of classes when we got let out early, and those that didn't felt dragged out.",
                    "50": "This class is a bit of a mess, but not hard. Definitely self teachable–– I feel like the lectures don't really add much to the class, as the resources on canvas are identical to what is said in lecture, just less confusing. Definitely felt like I wasted my time here, and lectures were boooooring. But, it's easy enough–– you should be fine.",
                    "51": "Some of the lectures and slides were very hard to follow. I appreciate the lenient grading and style of the class, though. It is not too difficult and a really good chill class that you may not have to put much effort into.",
                    "52": "This is the best stats class alternative for ECON and the course overall is really great at giving you a practical exposure to stats as you learn to do stats tests on a software and learn to really understand the use of stats in psychology. The professor is really funky and the lectures always have something strange going on but overall it is a pretty easy, chill class if you keep up with the course material which are provided in a really detailed and understandable way.",
                    "53": "Great course. Grades based off of homework assignments, team assignments, one midterm (week 5), and one final exam. The final and midterm are online. Professor bailey does a great job at making the material interesting, and he's very clear with what you should know for the exam.",
                    "54": "This course clearly and effectively went through the most common statistical analyses used by psychologists. Everything was laid out simply, and the learning process was very interesting.",
                    "55": "The course was great, the Prof. did his best to make a dry subject engaging.",
                    "56": "It was an okay class. It's a little annoying because you have two assignments due each week and one is a team assignment."

                    "1": "This course was not that difficult, as someone who is not good at math. I took it to fufill my math requirement. I would say the material can get confusing especially when going back to study and how the professor organizes his slides. But, overall the class was pretty good, not a lot of commitment needed. The team tasks can hurt your grade a bit if you don't work together with you team that well though.",
                    "2": "This course did not focus that much on psychology, but more on learning many different stats techniques. Professor smith did a good job explaining all of them, and it is not hard to do well in this course.",
                    "3": "Professor Smith was very caring and dedicated to ensuring his students learned this course's content, which consisted of various statistical techniques common in the social sciences. The primary forms of assessment in the course included two exams (1 midterm and 1 final; each worth 25% of your grade), homework assignments demanding application of the aforementioned statistical methods, at–home Canvas quizzes, and in–class team tasks. Professor Smith was also considerate by offering us two extra credit assignments involving data collection and application of statistical techniques using said data to draw conclusions. This course was not too demanding if you studied the lecture slides, which covered every assessed topic (the quizzes were very reflective of the lecture slides). The only challenge of the course was the precision of the answers needed on exams and homework assignments to earn full credit for questions. However, this was reasonable, given how statistics can only be used to draw specific conclusions. Overall, this course is very manageable and informative.",
                    "4": "It was a little difficult to focus in class because there was a  lot of content, but we were moving pretty fast. I often had to go over the presentations after class to make sure I understood what we were talking about. The presentations were very helpful and nicely organized though. Also, TAs for this class are outstanding and super helpful.",
                    "5": "The course overall was fine. The TAs and teacher seemed to make it harder than it should have been, as the grading was very off and would not include explanation of mistakes.",
                    "6": "This class is a very manageable stats requirement  so definitely take it with Professor Smith. He is very approachable, nice, and is willing to explain the concepts to ensure you understand. The course itself was not difficult at all but beware of the team tasks: if you have a bad group, this could lower your grade a lot and take you out of A contention. The homeworks, quizzes, and exams were fair and were reflected what was learned in–class. I definitely recommend taking with Professor Smith!",
                    "7": "This class is fine. The professor is really nice. His slides are kind of messy, so the concepts are not difficult (but how he presents it is). I like how he does a variety of team tasks, individual homework and take–home quizzes to study. The problem is that there are no practice midterm and final! So all you can do is study to the slides and practice all the material over and over again. I didn't open the textbook after the first week. I would recommend going to TA office hours!",
                    "8": "Prof Smith gives dad vibes like he's very chill, friendly, but I found it really easy to tune him out (that's also because of the course content I personally find statistics quite boring). I liked how our grade was broken down into team tasks, homework assignments and quizzes which made up a large component of our grade but each individual assignment wasn't worth that much of our overall grade so it lowered the pressure as well. I also got to know a few new people from the team tasks which doesn't happen in every class! I did not enjoy the format of the midterm because for a statistics course, there were more questions that required a written response explaining techniques than actual computational questions. The number of points assigned to each question also felt arbitrary and at times too high for a simple question – when I went to office hours to get clarification, the TA told me that most students only got 2/8 on this question. However, I do think that Prof Smith is acting on the feedback he received for the midterm because he said for our final there won't be any short answer questions and it'll be comprised of computational questions with a few MCQs.",
                    "9": "The slides are organized and helpful to look back on, but the lectures can be really dull. Teaching only from a slideshow for a math class makes it really hard to actually process the information. Also, there are often sneaky points on in–class team tasks or homeworks or even the midterm that are impossible to anticipate. Ask the TAs or professor to check your answers, even if you know your math is right, because there'll likely be something in the rubric that you're supposed to include that you aren't aware of. The concepts of the class aren't super difficult, it's just that Prof. Smith's lecture style is very disengaging, and even hard to keep up with, so it takes a lot of extra work to actually understand the application of the topics.",
                    "10": "This course is so easy but also not. While you're in class you will have no idea what's going on (I think this has a lot to do with Smith's teaching style) but once you do a practice problem with the team tasks it's easy. The material is not hard—especially if you have any stats or math skills—but the lectures are boring and the slides are hard to follow. I think with other teachers this class might be better. Attendance is mandatory to classes where team tasks happen but quizzes are out of class as well as the homework. There are 6 homework assignments, 6 quizzes, and 8 team tasks. The two tests make up 50% of your grade in the class and are difficult to prepare for as they provide you with virtually no extra practice. That being said, I have never taken statistics before and I found this class very easy.",
                    "11": "Stats is not a very interesting course, but Smith is a good lecturer and a kind professor.",
                    "12": "It is a nice course to learn about basic statistics, but the only thing that bugged me was a harsh grading",
                    "13": "Definitely more of a stats class than a psychology class.",
                    "14": "As I'm sure you know, this course is required for psych majors. Professor Smith is very nice, but a lot of times the slides, while he tried to keep them engaging, were worded in a confusing way and hard to follow.  To do well in this class you should attend every lecture and keep track of assignments, because there's a lot. You don't want to miss any team tasks which are during class time.",
                    "15": "I really enjoyed the team tasks.",
                    "16": "This class is bearable for a major requirement, but for people that don't love math, I would choose peace and avoid it. He's a great lecturer and great sense of humor, but things don't really click well in class and need to be explained further. Team tasks and Hws help your grade but the exams were kinda heinous",
                    "17": "professor smith was super nice and easy to approach if you ever needed help. he made sure to make the course entertaining and i just found his overall instructional style to be very good.",
                    "18": "TEAM TASKS ARE SO HELPFUL, your TAs are actively there too so ask questions and review the slides while working together because the slides are often helpful. Use the team task as studying for your homework because they are additional practice to master the topic of the week, and it will help immensely.",
                    "19": "I found this class challenging because I had never taken a stats class before. The grade heavily relies on team tasks, which is frustrating at times because if one person in your group gets the wrong answer, everyone in the group gets a bad grade. There is one midterm and one final exam. The midterm was very much a jumpscare because there were short–essay questions that we were not prepared for. I would not consider it an easy A.",
                    "20": "The TAs were not great.",
                    "21": "This is not an easy elective, if that’s what you’re searching for. Unless you took some kind of stats in high school, you’ll likely find that some of the concepts are hard to understand quickly, and there was not enough time provided for some team tasks. That said, the TAs’ grading did not keep these setbacks in mind and were quite harsh, so accumulate as many points as you can with quizzes and team tasks, also do all the extra credits.",
                    "22": "This course covers a lot of content at a decent pace. Professor Smith breaks the information down well during class and provides plenty of in class practice––be prepared that this practice is group work in which the groups are randomly assigned. Although not the most engaging class, you definitely learn alot. My roommate had took PSYCH 201 with a different teacher and it was taught completely differently so please be aware of that when choosing when and with whom to take this class. This class is not too much work––weekly homework and group work. Two exams––a midterm and a final. The midterm was hard, but Professor Smith and the TAs worked to curve the exam and give us extra credit opportunities. Professor Smith is very kind and wants to see his students succeed.",
                    "23": "Overall the class was fine. The course material itself wasn't too bad. But the thing about this class that really bothered me were the Team Tasks. In the beginning of the course, we took a placement test and were put into groups based on our performance. I ended up with a relatively bad group and had to do most of the work, which got pretty exhausting. A lot of the time, groups would go over the class time slot and it got frustrating. Also, the grading overall was a little iffy because sometimes it was unclear were points were lost. Like the TAs didn't really communicate that well. The midterm was also pretty rough but Professor Smith was kind and \"curved\" the exam.",
                    "24": "I would recommend this class as an FD/distro, especially with Professor Smith as he is extremely helpful, and a good lecturer. The homework and team tasks were helpful instead of feeling like busy work or impossible group work. I feel like I learned a lot with a decent amount of effort. The material is all able to be mastered, and nothing felt impossible. I appreciated the grading and lecturing style, as well as the structure of the midterm (and probably final).",
                    "25": "I thought it was okay. Personally, I am not very good with late classes so that took part. Smith is great, but I highly disliked his canvas organization. Everything was in the files tab, which always threw me in for a loop. It was a lecture, so you could only expect so much for covering that.  If you declare a psych major, there's a page that covers everything in stats psych and that really helped me. Even though I didn't really enjoy the lectures, smith and the TAs were so helpful whenever I had questions. Overall, it was okay.",
                    "26": "I did feel frustrated with the fact that 20% of our grade was team tasks, meaning that our grade was dependent on how other students in our team performed, which felt quite unfair at times.",
                    "27": "Not a hard class. Sometimes frustrating to loose points on the team tasks because of the mistakes of others in your group. Midterm short answer questions were also kind of hard. Overall good class.",
                    "28": "I think it is important to study for the course as it progresses. The course goes by really fast with really detailed explanations of some concepts, but not as much for others (so reading the textbook is a must).  Additionally, the in–class assignments (8) are group–based to help understand and apply the information, so if you're into that kind of thing... Finally, the computations for this course were practiced and performed by hand, which makes memorizing all the information a bit harder (so it is very important to study for the exams).",
                    "29": "I think I learned a good amount but to be honest the group work in this class stinks, brought my grade down a lot. Professor Smith is super nice and will help you out if you ask, definitely just boring cause the topic is boring",
                    "30": "This class teaches what it is supposed to—so it's not very interesting, but it's to the point. You can keep up if you stay engaged with lectures (the professor is great at explaining). The homework and quizzes are reasonable. Our class did poorly on the midterm, and it was graded kind of interestingly, but the professor decided to scale so results turned out okay.",
                    "31": "Solid course, Prof. Smith is great and so are the TAs.",
                    "32": "I learned a lot in this class and the lecture slides were always very helpful. I appreciated that the exams always directly reflected the material on the slides, in class, in team tasks, and homework assignments. Professor Smith always found ways to make lecture engaging with jokes and music. Also, the office hours were helpful with discussing exam grades and generally gaining a better understanding of the knowledge so that you do not fall behind. The workload is definitely tolerable.",
                    "33": "He was a very passionate instructor and introduced the class to statistical topics in a digestible way.",
                    "34": "Good class coming from someone not good at / interested in math (or psych).  Not too much work and work is not too difficult. Fair amount of grades and extra credit, so grade not reliant on exam scores. Class is very organized – lectures one day, team task another day. Lectures can be hard to follow because sometimes took a long time complicating a relatively simple concept, but if you go over and review it is fine. TAs and profs good at clarifying any confusions.",
                    "35": "I learned how many psychology studies are calculated which was helpful for me",
                    "36": "This was a pretty solid class. I'd say it's pretty easy. The class consists of weekly HW and quizzes, each taking about 15 minutes or less to complete. The midterm wasn't that bad either, although short answer questions are graded weirdly. The calculation Qs are fine but almost every point I lost was on the short answer. There's also this thing called team tasks, where a significant portion of your grade depends on teamwork. Going into the class I thought this would be a headache but it's actually not that bad and it's a good way to reinforce learning. Prof Smith is a pretty chill guy, but the way he explains some concepts is a little unclear/not that straightforward.  Nonetheless its a pretty easy class.",
                    "37": "Professor Smith is an amazing teacher and is always willing to help. This class is great for establishing a good baseline fro statistics.",
                    "38": "This class isn't particularly hard at all, but it's not interesting at all. I found it very hard to stay focused in lecture so before the exams I was essentially just teaching myself everything but that wasn't an issue because the content was relatively easy. Manageable A for sure if you study for the exams and actually put effort into the team tasks. Professor Smith is the nicest person ever and is really sweet but the lectures are somewhat tedious.",
                    "39": "This class was amazing! I thought the lectures were very clear and enjoyed the team tasks. The homework is very reasonable and covers topics talked about in class/done on team tasks. The professor was also great! I thought he explained topics very clearly and was always open to answering questions. Overall, this was a great class and I would recommend it to anyone interested in psychology!",
                    "40": "I really liked this course. Specifically, I enjoyed the team tasks and being able to talk through questions and problems with my group.",
                    "41": "This course is kindof hard! It is very fast paced but if you study hard you should be fine.",
                    "42": "I took this class because I am psych major and found the class to be pretty boring. Professor H. David Smith is a really sweet guy and great at answering questions, but lectures are extremely boring. Throughout the course, there are several quick homework assignments to complete, some quizzes, and team tasks. Team tasks are completed in class with a group. Everyone works together to complete them and they are helpful for better understanding the material. Quizzes are completed outside of class online. Homework assignments are also outside of class. Homework and quizzes are fairly straightforward and simple. All of the work is done by hand with calculators instead of online like other psych stats classes. There is one midterm and one final. The exams are not too bad if you study. Some questions, however, are worth a lot of points so it is easy to make one mistake and lose several points. Office hours are extremely helpful and I would recommend going to them!! Overall, it is not too challenging though and does not take a lot of time outside of class.",
                    "43": "Overall, I thought the class was very easy to keep up with, and the workload was light. I would definitely take it as a stats requirement, and there were team–based tasks each week which were fun.",
                    "44": "Class is engaging and the professor is kind and funny. We usually have team tasks in the class. I feel like sometimes the lecture goes by too fast and I can't keep up with the pace. Or the wordings of the assignments or questions in the exam are very confusing. For the exam, I usually have to reread all the slides and self–study because in class I couldn't process the information. But I really like the class, so you should definitely take it!",
                    "45": "Smith is a good lecturer! His slides are easy to follow and the course layout is really satisfying. As good as a statistics class can get, for me, personally.",
                    "46": "This course is sort of an easy A if you understand stats. The second part moves very quickly so you have to be on top of your work. But overall the class isn’t too bad.",
                    "47": "I really enjoyed this course. I don't enjoy math very much so I wasn't really looking forward to it, but I was pleasantly surprised by how fun it was.",
                    "48": "Dr. Smith seems like a really nice guy, so it pains me to say that this is probably the worst class I've taken at Northwestern. The class itself is organized so terribly, including the Canvas page, which is impossible to navigate. The lectures are extremely boring, and Dr. Smith is obviously knowledgeable, but to the point where he is wordy. I feel like he just can't communicate things well. Also, in his office hours he frequently makes mistakes and doesn't seem to know what he is doing. The same applies for one of the TAs––she is a harsh grader, but also can't help students during Team Tasks without consulting the answer key. The Team Tasks are by far the worst and least helpful part of the course. We are never given enough time and if you have a bad team, like I did, you're actually screwed because we have them every single week and are one of the only grades you receive in the class. I feel like the actual content isn't that bad, but the class in itself does not promote deep understanding. which is reflected in the exam averages and drop rate. If you have to take this class and have never taken AP Stats, consider a different professor and pray you get a good group.",
                    "49": "Grades were made up of take home quizzes, homework, team tasks, midterm, and final. The team tasks were horrible. Your grade depends on how well your group members do on a work sheet. Midterm was curved.",
                    "50": "Not really sure how this course connects to psychology. It is more of a stats class.",
                    "51": "I really did enjoy this course. The teacher is super nice and good at giving the lectures. The work outside of the class is extremely manageable and helpful for reviewing the class material (1 homework assignment and one at–home multiple choice quiz each week). Every week we would also have one day of lecture and one day of a \"Team Task\" where we would work in groups on a worksheet. I always found this very effective. The exams also seem to be quite reasonable. And there is not a cumulative final which is nice. Overall, good course, especially as a psych requirement, and I think it fairly easy to do well in the class.",
                    "52": "Yo this class was like a math class for humanities majors. If you’re a stem person, it will be majorly chill for you. Highly suggest.",
                    "53": "This class is alright considering that the material it's teaching is probably not the most interesting to the people who have to take it but I do wish some of the information taught (primarily how to solve and answer questions) was not either lost in the middle of slideshows or simply not explained at all. I get that a conceptual understanding is necessary for learning but for how often tasks and homework emphasized how questions needed to be answered, there is an unfortunate lack of that information provided in my opinion. I feel that this class overall fails to teach its students in any meaningful way.",
                    "54": "Overall not a bad experience. Lectures weren't very engaging so it was a struggle to fully pay attention.",
                    "55": "This course was fast paced and the exams were difficult, but team tasks and homeworks were a good way to improve my grade"

                    "1": "This class was a very reasonable class for those not acquainted with statistics. Prof. Gorvine did an amazing job at helping others understand, and he was such an amazing professor who reached out to students. I appreciate his efforts!",
                    "2": "If you have any background in math, this course will be a breeze for you (I honestly think that they could make a five–week version of the course). Lectures were once a week, the other day was used for team exercises to practice what we did in lecture (we always got out early on these days). I spent ten minutes max on the homework each week. I wish the lectures were shorter, because sometimes the course felt super slow. Ben Gorvine is helpful, kind, and not afraid to be a little silly for his students. I highly recommend taking classes with him. Exams were all remote which had its pros and cons.",
                    "3": "It was great!! Especially for a topic that isn't inherently intriguing or creatively stimulating – Prof. Gorvine does the best truly.",
                    "4": "Pretty easy and straightforward course. Gorvine is great and incorporates humor into his lectures, which is nice in a course like this. One day a week is lecture and the other is a team exercise, which is helpful in reinforcing the concepts from that week. Very little out–of–class work",
                    "5": "Although this course focuses on tough material, Professor Gorvine explains topics very thoroughly and with patience. He is very open to helping students wherever he can.",
                    "6": "I enjoyed this class. I liked the team exercise because they gave you a chance to practice everything and check your work with your group. Overall did not take up a lot of time outside of class and Prof made it fun.",
                    "7": "I am glad that this course taught many statistic concepts that I find useful outside of class. I feel that this course has taught me the basics of statistics that will be useful if I decide to further my understanding of this.",
                    "8": "This class was decent. Gorvine was great and did an amazing job at keeping class engaging and fun. The exams covered A LOT of material. The class in general covers a lot of material. I thought that the final exam was a bit extensive. Overall, a super passable class––I really appreciated all of the group work.",
                    "9": "1. Focus <br><br>The focus of this class is a basic introduction into statistics. Really the only reason it’s a psych class is because all the examples used in class are psychological. We go through types of data, z–tests, single sample t–tests, independent and dependent t–tests, ANOVA, chi–squared tests, correlation tests, and a couple other things. <br><br>2. Class time<br><br>Classes were Mondays and Wednesdays. Every Monday we had a lecture with slides, and every Wednesday we had a team exercise, basically a set of problems we had to work on with 3–4 other people. These were occasionally pretty hard but usually not that bad, and we usually got out of class early on these days. <br><br>3. Assessments<br><br>We had an online midterm and final, each 2 hours long. We also had weekly online quizzes which were 12 questions each, and took around 10–15 minutes, these were mostly conceptual and didn;t require calculations. Then there were the team exercises and a short very easy weekly homework assignment that mirrored the team exercise but much simpler. <br><br>4. Instruction<br><br>Gorvine was an enthusiastic lecturer, though the lectures were sometimes slightly disorganized/hard to follow. This might just have been me though because statistics tends to confuse me. Either way, the lectures were much clearer than reading the textbook. <br><br>5. Advice<br><br>Work hard on the team exercises because they’re a surpridingly large portion of your grade, and make sure you know the differences/when to use each statistical procedure. <br><br>6. TLDR<br><br>Well taught class, definitely not too hard even for someone who struggles with thinking about statistics. Very little work outside of class, maybe 30 minutes a week if you combine the quiz and homework assignment.",
                    "10": "Good course, easy",
                    "11": "This is a really easy class if you pay attention. The teaching style is very helpful. Once a week we work in teams and I really enjoyed it, especially because it is an amazing way to prepare for exams. The exams are pretty okay, just make sure to know the content and you should be alright. It should not be hard to get an A in the class, but it is also really easy to miss that A because of minor errors made with any assignment.",
                    "12": "Having to take this class for my major, I was nervous about it but this was the best professor to take it with. I really liked the order of class – lecture Mondays team assignment wednesdays and it was a great way to learn and practice with really utilizing class time",
                    "13": "This course is really weirdly structured. We had quizzes BEFORE lecture on Monday mornings, outside of class, monitored, closed–book exams, sometimes recorded (1 hour+) lectures, etc. There was a lot of work that allegedly were structured for \"better learning\" but I'm not sure if it actually worked. I came in not liking or understanding statistics, and I left the same way.",
                    "14": "LOVED THE CLASS! I am not a math person however the professor does everything possible to make it easy for everyone to love math",
                    "15": "This class is easy to get lost in if you fall behind on coursework, but honestly it should not be too difficult for most people, no matter the level of knowledge you had coming into the class",
                    "16": "If you have any stats experience, you'll do fine in this class. And if you don't, you'll probably be fine. 1 Midterm and 1 Final, the final is non–cumulative and only covers the second half of class. Both are take–home. The hardest part were the weekly quizzes but skimming the textbook, and online quizzes should help you do fine. Good class. If you're looking for a prerequisite for IMC, I'd recommend this class.",
                    "17": "Professor Gorvine is amazing! I really like the team exercises. The quizzes and the exams are little hard though.  As an avid mathematics hater, this course was not too bad.",
                    "18": "Honestly, as a psych major, this wasn't a super difficult class just make sure you attend lectures and definitely go to class on days where there are team exercises.",
                    "19": "This class is sooooo boring but its really easy",
                    "20": "Ok Gorvine is THE BEST<br>if you're not good at math you do need to study BUT <br>15 question online lockdown browser quiz each week<br>group exercises each Wednesday (lecture Monday) <br>super short problem set each week<br>not too much work, just study for the midterms <br>2 exams, online, lockdown browser he gives SO MUCH partial credit <br>and you get extra credit if you do tophat<br>take it with Gorvine!!",
                    "21": "Professor Gorvine was very kind and truly did his best to try and make statistics as fun as possible (even though it is quite impossible to do so unfortunately). I found that the multiple choice portions of the quizzes and tests were pretty difficult to study for and sometimes did not reflect was was taught in the slides. I also found that the tophat questions were pretty difficult to get correct and overall obtain the extra credit. The class overall wasn't too stressful. Am I satisfied with my grade? Not exactly. Do I recommend this course? I suppose. The vibes were not horrendous.",
                    "22": "Gorvine was an amazing and understanding professor which was very appreciated. I thought he made the class about as interesting as it could have been.",
                    "23": "There are many grading components to this class, which could be a good thing or a bad things. Relatively straightforward if you listen in class and do the team exercises (which also count towards your grade).",
                    "24": "This is a good class for a math distro. If you took AP Stats, the first 7 weeks are review and the last few concepts are not too bad. The tests are straightforward and based a lot on the team exercises. The word problems on the quizzes can be confusing and sometimes don't feel related to the lectures.  Professor Gorvine is great and is always willing to answer additional questions or provide clarification. The final is an exam and a media report which does not take too long.",
                    "25": "Prof Gorvine is AWESOME! He is a really great teacher and makes class entertaining. He taught very clearly and organized and we did team work on wednesdays which was super helpful. Only issue with this class is that the tests were extremely difficult.",
                    "26": "This course was very straight forward and helped me learn as all the resources were extremely accessible and easily comprehendible.",
                    "27": "Overall a great psych class. Learned a lot, and as long as you go to class, its not a hard class.",
                    "28": "BEN GORVINE IS THE BEST!! take this class with him please!! he genuinely wants you to learn and understand and his approach to statistical methods is to make it not scary for people like me that have struggled with it in the past. if you pay attention and practice, this class is easy to do well in. sometimes his lectures are a little slow but he’s a fun guy",
                    "29": "This material in this class can be a little challenging but the professor does a good job explaining it and making sure you have a lot of opportunities learn.",
                    "30": "I think this course was pretty okay. Prof Gorvine was super nice and was always willing to help. I think the slides weren't the best, the homework and team exercises were helpful for the exams. The quizzes were a bit harder since they were not computational and mostly based off facts. Pretty easy to get an A or A– if you do all of the assignments.",
                    "31": "Gorvine is the best prof and explains everything so well. I never took stats before this and was able to understand the content easily. Exams are pretty simple as long as you stay on top of assignments and make a good formula sheet. Homeworks and team assignments are similar so if you understand how to do a test you will be fine. Overall great course.",
                    "32": "Easy distro or stats course if you need it for your major or premed. You will do well if you have the slightest inclination to use equations and plug numbers into a calculator. The only out–of–class things you have to do are a \"homework assignment\" once a week (usually just what we did in the team exercise with different numbers, takes 45 mins max), weekly quizzes (based on lectures and sometimes the TB, capped at 15 min), and a media report assignment at the end of the quarter (just 1–2 pages, takes maybe 1.5h). Lectures are on Monday and team exercises (problem sets you work with in a team assigned to you at the start of the quarter) are on Wednesday. Lecture isn't required, but they aren't recorded and there is the opportunity for extra credit in class thru tophat. Team exercises are easy and if you get stumped, TAs and prof are quick to help. Don't worry about group work, this is a grade boost. Only one midterm and a final are both remote(50% of overall grade). You can use an equation sheet, and questions are essentially what was presented in class.  The final exam, I will say, was difficult and comprised of seemingly irrelevant topics. This could definitely tank your grade down one or two letters. All assessments use lockdown software which is kind of annoying but understandable for cheating purposes. You do learn actual stats in this class, but don't expect explanations for equations. Pretty easy for non–math people, but maybe disappointing for others. Nevertheless, an very easy course that will pair well if you need to take more challenging things simultaneously.  Take it with Gorvine, you might struggle with another prof.",
                    "33": "Really great course. I was not interested in statistics at all before this and just took it as a major requirement but it made me really enjoy the topic. There are many opportunities to boost your grade with team exercises and homework assignments. The weekly quizzes are somewhat challenging, but there are only 2 exams, neither of which are exceedingly difficult.",
                    "34": "This course was extremely good. One lecture a week with a team exercise about material learned. Weekly homework which is easy if you follow along with material. Two exams which are online (low–key sucks). We have a chance for extra credit through poll questions which is helpful to your overall grade.",
                    "35": "Having a thorough understanding basic statistics tests",
                    "36": "The course was overall very well–designed and very very fairly graded. My only qualm with it is the fact that I'm not personally a math person, which made the material very uninteresting and challenging for me. The course structure accommodates for this, though, and the team exercises are an amazing opportunity to get help from peers if you're unsure about a certain subject.",
                    "37": "I loved Gorvine. He knew what he was talking about and was really understanding and nice. Just make sure to go to class and this class will not be awful for you.",
                    "38": "This class is pretty straightforward and somewhat easy. There are like 6 quizzes, 1 midterm, 1 final, and 1 media report. You will also have to do team exercises with your assigned group every Wednesday, and also have homework due on mondays before class. All of the work is pretty easy to do and understand if you go to lectures on mondays and write good notes. The midterm and final can be a bit hard to do with all of the computations you have to know how to do but at least the final isn't cumulative. Should be a not too hard class to take.",
                    "39": "I was a little nervous about this class because I've never taken a stats course in my life. But I'm so glad I chose this one as the intro!! Professor Gorvine is amazing. I love how this class is a blend of homework assignments, team activities, exams,  and quizzes so nothing is too heavily weighted. I feel like I was well prepared for both the quizzes and exams. I do recommend getting (look online for a free PDF version) AND READING the textbook  because there were sometimes questions on the quizzes that I feel I wouldn't have known without reading the book. Highly recommend this class if you need to fulfill a stats requirement like I did!",
                    "40": "Great course. I believe that the team exercises truly do help.!",
                    "41": "This was the best possible stats class. Prof. Gorvine is so thoughtful and engaging, and genuinely cares about his students. We covered a lot of material (about 1–2 statistical tests/per week), but the course structure made it feel manageable. The team tasks could be frustrating because my group was small and not great with attendance, but this seemed like a rare situation. You only need to read the textbook if you want to do well on the weekly quizzes, but they are a small part of the grade. The exams and quizzes are lockdown browser, which can be stressful. I prefer taking exams in a classroom because there are less distractions.",
                    "42": "Take this class with Prof. Gorvine! He is amazing, kind, super helpful, and a great lecturer.",
                    "43": "I believe that Gorvine did a great job of explaining information and simplifying complicated concepts for people to understand. The class did feel like a decent amount of work with constant textbook reading, weekly quizzes, homework, and team tasks but overall they helped with your learning of the subject. As someone who doesn't enjoy math, I was skeptical of taking this class at first, but I think that if you put in the work and try on assignments you can do well in this class.",
                    "44": "Assigned readings were not necessary in my opinion; team exercises were helpful/added a nice element of engagement to the course; lectures could get boring at times but that's expected with this sort of subject – TopHat questions made it a bit more engaging; appreciated that the course had natural exam study materials with other homework/team exercise versions; weekly quizzes could be stressful, but aren't a huge portion of your grade; professor was super kind and I felt comfortable asking him questions",
                    "45": "Overall, this was a good introduction to statistics! I didn't take AP Statistics in high school and found this course fairly manageable. One lecture per week is dedicated to a slideshow covering content and the other is dedicated to completing a group activity to apply these concepts, which I found very helpful. The lectures do need to be supplemented with the textbook readings, as the weekly quizzes rely heavily on the textbook. Additionally, the quizzes and exams for this course are in a take–home online format!",
                    "46": "again this is a great course for not really mathy people looking to fill distro",
                    "47": "Professor Gorvine is a treasured and I recommend taking any class with him if you can. He's always willing to help, and he makes his lectures charming, funny, and engaging. Statistics can be an incredibly dry subject, but I loved going to his lectures. 80 minutes can be a lot when it's about stats but he does his best to make it entertaining. Always go to lecture if you can, it's just better to absorb it there and while the slides are informative I would go if you feel like you need it. The homeworks and team exercises add up to be a decent bit of your grade (10% and 25% respectively), so be sure to do it thoughtfully but it's very straightforward.",
                    "48": "Overall, this was a manageable, but not breezy, class. Some tips to do well:<br>– Stay on top of the material by spreading out your learning. There's a lot of content, and reading the textbook is very helpful for the first half of class to get a foundational understanding of all of this (especially if you're like me and have never taken a stats class before). But reading the textbook takes a while, so spread out your reading (e.g.: if 20 pages of reading and 5 days to do it, do 4 pages/day).<br>– Take good notes you can constantly reflect back on. This material really builds on itself.<br>– GO TO CLASS, it is NOT recorded (also you have to go pretty much every Weds for the group work)",
                    "49": "Very very very good course. Very manageable hw and class work; class laid out in a way that actually helps you. Was not interested at all initially and was not planning to put in much effort, but in the end, I think I learned the most from the class. Gorvine sets up the class that makes you know the material subconsciously.",
                    "50": "Take this class!!!! It’s a wonderful introduction to statistics and Professor Gorvine is such a good teacher and also a complete sweetheart. He’s funny and made the class very engaging and enjoyable. I had never taken statistics before so I was slightly scared but I was surprised to find out I really liked it and now want to take other statistics classes because I enjoyed this one so much. It is challenging at times but not hard and Professor Gorvine really wants everyone to succeed. A lot goes into your grade, with weekly quizzes, weekly homework, weekly team exercises, a fun and short media report and two exams. There also is a TopHat extra credit opportunity and some extra credit opportunities in the team exercises and in general, I don’t think it’s hard to do well in the class. I highly recommend this class and would take it again if I could!",
                    "51": "Professor Gorvine made a class that everyone dreads as enjoyable as possible. Please take this class with him!",
                    "52": "I've never taken a stats course before this and I found it very helpful. Professor Gorvine does a great job at ensuring that he breaks down even the more complicated topics.",
                    "53": "I took this course for a major requirement. I would not consider myself a very math–oriented person, and I was still able to do well in this class. Professor Gorvine and the TAs are very helpful during the team excercise days. I was a big fan of how this class is just Mon and Wed, so I felt like there was ample time to study/complete the HW, and it was nice that the class was broken up into very distinct lecture vs team work days, which helped me learn a lot and gave us extra study materials for the exams.",
                    "54": "Had to take this class for psych major, great with Gorvine! I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Gorvine is great at explaining things, homework is pretty straightforward. Overall pretty manageable",
                    "55": "This class was very manageable. Team exercises were sometimes tedious and depends largely on who is in your group. There are many extra credit opportunities available. Homework assignments were very easy. The weekly quizzes and exams are slightly harder, but allow you to have a formula sheet and are online which makes it convenient to take on your own time.",
                    "56": "It was challenging but doable.",
                    "57": "If you have to take psych stats, take it with Gorvine! He is a really clear lecture and does a lot to make the class fun (weekly meme competitions, funny jokes in the slides, etc). I was worried because I came into the class never having taken stats in high school, but it is really easy to follow along. The way the class was set up is that once a week you have lecture and the other day you practice what you learned in lecture with a group of 5 other people. There are weekly homeworks (which are pretty short) and two midterm exams that you take virtually. If you attend lecture and do the homeworks an A is very attainable.",
                    "58": "The lectures were effective and well organized and the presentations were very helpful tools for clarification, I thought this course was manageable and, at times, a bit interesting, however, I found myself absolutely dreading the days when we would complete an activity sheet in groups. This component of the course, which has a rather large impact on your overall grade, makes no sense to me. I found that I did not learn anything from working with my group members and instead felt intense anxiety over the fact that I had only so much influence over my grade due to the fact that grades for this component are determined both by group performance and individual correctness. The time pressure was grating, the chaos of the classroom and the cramped desk spaces did not help and the group–component only hindered my learning and mental clarity with regards to picking up the material. I would much rather have wished that these were individual assignments completed on our own time. Students with certain accommodations should take this into consideration before electing to register for this course.",
                    "59": "HIGHLY RECOMMEND! I thoroughly enjoyed this course, definitely take with Ben Gorvine. Professor Gorvine is very enthusiastic about the subject matter and is always willing to help his students in any way he can (e.g., email, office hours). The homework wasn't too bad, as long as you pay attention in class and take good notes. Not an easy A, but very do–able!"

                    "0": "Disclaimer: only take this course if you have enough time and energy to do a lot of pre–lecture readings and videos, write six discussion posts weekly (each about 130 words in order to maximize your marks, 2 posts will be your questions while 4 other posts will be your responses to other people's questions), and complete two 2–page double–spaced free response questions weekly. I definitely struggled with the workload given in this course during the first two weeks of the quarter. However, once you get the hang of it, you'll get used to the flow. Prof Molden is a great lecturer and quite humorous and engaging.",
                    "1": "I really loved this class! It was cool to learn about so many different studies on topics relevant to our own lives. If you prefer take–home writing/papers over timed tests, this is definitely a good choice.",
                    "2": "This course was super engaging and interesting, definitely one of the classes I have learned the most from at Northwestern. There was quite a lot of homework, 2 discussion posts, and 2 responses due weekly, and depending on what week either 1 or 2 short essays due weekly. The discussion posts were quite simple and graded on completion, however, the short essay questions were more complicated and the grading for those were harsh. I would suggest going to office hours and reviewing the short essay before submitting to get the best grade possible.",
                    "3": "Take this class. It is super interesting and is not that hard. However it does take a lot of time outside class to complete the modules, packback questions, and short answer questions. Every week you have a lot of work out of class so only take this class if you are really interested in the topics. Getting good grades in the SAQs is not hard. Although some of them are tricky you can always reach out to TA's.",
                    "4": "I loved this course. It is kind of a lot of work but it doesn't feel like it because the content is really interesting. You learn so much about people's social motives and how this effects behavior. Professor Molden is so fun and great at teaching.",
                    "5": "The class is not too bad, but I'm not sure if you cover really anything \"brand new\" to an intro to psych class. It is pretty writing intensive, with about 2 2–page papers due each week and discussions due on Packback quite frequently. The lecture videos are all posted, but attendance is taken using iClicker each class session. <br>The only complaint about the class I have is the pre–recorded lecture videos we were asked to watch before classes seemed kind of repetitive to what was talked about in class. That and the TAs seemed to determine grades by throwing at a dart board, their feedback was not the best, so it was hard to learn how to improve your writing. I talked about this with several other students throughout the course who had a similar experience.",
                    "6": "This class is good if you are more of a take–home essay type of person –– however, it does require a lot of time because even though we don't have traditional midterms or finals,  the short answer essays each week are relatively time–consuming as there can be up to two a week.",
                    "7": "This class was pretty difficult to get used to at first since it is a different style of class, but once you know how to handle it, it isn't too bad. The assignments take a bit of work, but if you take good notes then it is easier. My biggest piece of advice is don't push everything off until the last minute since there is a lot of stuff do on Sundays and Mondays.",
                    "8": "I really enjoyed this course because it taught me so much more about social psychology beyond what I had learned in high school. The class was really interactive, and the lecture videos were really helpful in preparing me for class.",
                    "9": "I was able to gain insight into the human behaviors and social psychology.",
                    "10": "I learned a lot in this class and Professor Molden was an engaging lecturer. Because we did not have tests, the weekly homework did end up feeling like a lot also because the modules were always due back to back. Otherwise, the course was interesting and not too hard. The material and content was well selected.",
                    "11": "Daily assignments made this class a lot more work than I expected. There were video lectures that were time consuming and made in class time redundant. We had to pay for a discussion board instead of using canvas which I didn't like.",
                    "12": "I had to do some work outside of class previewing and reviewing to be able to complete the short answer questions because they required a thorough understanding and application of the materials.",
                    "13": "A lot of supplemental work outside of class to focus on in class discussions. Prof was good, although pre–recorded lectures were a bit repetitive. Prof. was very engaging.",
                    "14": "Doesn't have exams, instead has short answer questions and discussion posts. Could take two psych classes at a time without as much pressure.<br>Molden is mid lecturer but content is mostly interesting. <br>Didn't have to do any of the readings in the class and got by fine (I just liked watching the videos).",
                    "15": "Prof. Molden's unique approach to a pretty standard course makes the content more interesting, in my opinion. While it was hard at first to time out the weekly workload, eventually the class got into a rhythm and it was straightforward to keep track of modules and short answer assignments. The short answer assignments hold significantly more weight than other aspects of the class, so I would suggest taking good notes on the modules to make your life writing the short answers easier. Although some of the content Prof. Molden assigns to read doesn't end up being very useful for formulating written answers, he cares about the course and his attention to questions in class shows this.",
                    "16": "I was really excited to take this course as I have interest in the field of social psychology, and I don't think it is a bad class, it just wasn't what all that I expected. I found some of the topics covered I had already learned in AP Psychology. The new content was interesting and useful, but it was sometimes hard to fully enjoy it with the amount of writing we had to do.",
                    "17": "While the short answers were a bit difficult sometimes, they did really force you to learn the concepts and how to apply them to real life situations. I feel like you come out of the class with a good grasp of psychological concepts and how to use them in daily life.",
                    "18": "The class is interesting and easy, but it's pretty time consuming because you have 3 discussion posts due every class and around 2 short essay assignments due every week. However, the grading on the discussion posts are basically participation and the grading on the assignments is chill. Final exam is open note. Good psych elective or distro!",
                    "19": "This is probably the most time–intensive psych class I've taken at NU (I'm a senior who has taken a lot of psych classes). The material is very useful and applicable to real life, but the professor makes it clear at the start of the quarter that you'll have to put in a lot of time. In place of exams, there are 1–2 nearly weekly assignments (max 2 pages each) that ask you to apply the material to a hypothetical situation. You also have to watch recorded lectures and do readings before each class. There is a discussion post and 2 responses based on the readings/videos due the day before each class on a separate website called Packback, and each post or comment you make is graded using AI. That said, if you go to class and put in the work, it's very easy to get an A. There are also 3 opportunities for extra credit which occur in place of the usual class time, so it's definitely nice to have 3 classes off. If you're interested in the topic but have a heavy schedule, I'd suggest taking this class during a different quarter.",
                    "20": "Professor Molden has a style of teaching that i understand doesn't really work for everyone but it 100% worked for me. He posts videos and readings before class and then goes over the concepts in the lecture sections, all the SAQs are based on the modules you cover. It's not like the workload is heavy but it is something that you have to try and be consistent with, the take–home final exam is basically just more SAQs which is nice.",
                    "21": "This is not the level 200 psych class you are looking for. Prof molden, as lovely as he is, does not know how to explain things that should be simple in a clear and coherent way. The flipped classroom format is also incredibly time consuming and repetitive. Is it hard? no. Is it nice that you dont have exams? yes. but it is just annoying at times.",
                    "22": "I did not like this course at all. The lecture is an hour and a half of Professor Molden speaking non–stop about factors, and studies, and everything under the sun every single class period. We have 2 discussion posts and a discussion question on a different website that you have to pay for due every class and 2–two page papers per week as well.  The class also speaks on social psych in very strict right and wrong approaches which is counterproductive to understanding human behavior. Overall I would not recommend the course however there are no exams and it is contract grading, so there are some positive aspects of the class as well. I would look for another class but if you have to take it, it won't be the worst class you ever take.",
                    "23": "I think the online discussions and the written homework assignments were important to helping me learn, and also going over everything during the in person lectures helped.",
                    "24": "Awesome course and Molden is a great guy and Professor. You will learn concepts through research and apply them. However, the workload is no joke – seriously. The pre–lecture materials take hours to work through each (and there are two on Mon &amp; Wed). You will learn a lot and go in depth as a result but it is seriously a lot if you engage as much as you should. However, the content is fascinating and you will actually see what you learn in the world around you and feel like you have some \"superpowers\" after taking it. Professor Molden is clearly an experienced teacher.",
                    "25": "The content of this course is very interesting and you will learn a lot. If you are looking for a distro class that is not as time consuming, this class may not be for you. Although the material is not difficult, there is a lot of busy work with 2 discussion posts and 2 short answer questions due each week. There are no exams which is nice but if you feel like you won't be able to put in the time for busy work then I would not recommend this class. Overall, not too stressful of a class but would not consider it that easy of an A. Lots of extra credit opportunities!",
                    "26": "This course is a lot of work. Every class has a discussion post and two responses due based on readings that take an hour to an hour and a half. These posts are due a day before the class, which leads to you having work due at 11 AM  on Sunday morning. While these are graded for completion, the two two–page assignments are certainly not and they are graded harshly. While this course was pretty interesting and I liked Professor Molden as a lecturer, I would say that this class was not worth it unless you have to take it or you are really interested.",
                    "27": "I love psychology so I thoroughly enjoyed this course. I will say that it can be very time–consuming considering a lot of the learning is done outside the classroom through online modules and Packback discussion boards. That being said, there are no midterm exams so that can relieve some stress during midterm week while trying to juggle so many other classes. The lectures were interesting and related a lot of topics to current events which I found very interesting. In all, I liked the course and I'm glad I took it to broaden my knowledge of psychology.",
                    "28": "The discussion posts and short answer responses we had to do for this class were quite annoying. First of all, we had to pay $40 to use a specific website for our discussion posts when we could've easily used Canvas. We also had to do 2 posts and respond to 4 posts every week. On top of that, we also had to do two 2–page response papers every weekend. It just all seemed like a lot of unnecessary work, but at least we didn't have any exams! The lectures themselves were a little dull; I think they would've worked better as 50–minute lectures rather than 70 minutes. Prof. Molden is sweet and good at explaining more difficult concepts. He also made the class as engaging as possible which I appreciated. But as someone who doesn't particularly like psychology that much, this wasn't exactly my favorite class.",
                    "29": "This class is a LOT of work. Weekly essay assignments due, asynchronous videos to watch, participation in class, questions and answers on the asynchronous videos.  This is not an easy class. While the questions are not that difficult, it is a lot of strenuous work.",
                    "30": "This class was a lot of work. There are no exams but there are multiple weekly assignments which take a while to do.",
                    "31": "There were a lot of writing assignments and readings/lecture videos, but it balances out the fact that there were no exams. Also, the discussion posts made the class feel a lot more interactive. However, there was not a lot of feedback given on how to improve in the short answer questions. The class material was fascinating, and Professor Molden made classes as interactive as possible with iClicker and such.",
                    "32": "The scheduling of the homework assignments is unfortunately pretty annoying. I understand the intention behind the multiple platforms for assignments, but some of them feel like busy work. <br><br>Packback was an online service in which you had to submit a question about the course content by 11am the day before class. Then you had to reply to 2 peers by 6pm later that day. Weird deadlines, but the professor explains it as him wanting to incorporate discussion and lectures. This doesn’t always happen, but when it does, it takes the form of a 20–second mention during class and he adds a little logo to the slideshow.<br><br>The contributions to this platform do not really seem to shape the lectures in any meaningful way. It’s sort of just “Someone mentioned X on packback,” brief response, and then he moves on to the next topic. And yes, people did seemingly do research and respond others, but I think that was less of genuine interest in learning and more so that two responses were required, and the platform really liked if you cited a link.<br><br>As far as the lecture videos go (assigned before each class), I really do not know why these are assigned so much. They often use the exact same slides and exact examples of research as we go over in class, so I don’t know why we needed to hear it twice, but maybe it is useful to reinforce the content. However, while these were somewhat annoying to watch in the moment, they were extremely helpful for the final exam &amp; homework assignments. <br><br>Regarding the homework assignments, for as much as they wanted to encourage open ended thoughtful responses, it very much felt like there was a \"right\" answer to the questions. For most of them, it was somewhat obvious where they wanted you to go with the answer. They would all ask for \"research\" to support your answers, but this research was almost always pulled straight from either the week's lectures or lecture videos, or both. If your answer didn't quote align with the class' explanation or research examples, you lost points. <br><br>The professor does present the information in an interesting way, and I liked the course, but the unrelenting busy work is frustrating at times. There are also frequent engaging activities in class that add depth to the lectures. I appreciated the use of iClicker to both take attendance &amp; facilitate direct contributions from everyone in the class. Overall, the work adds up quickly, but the class is interesting and informative. He knows this though, and, for what it's worth, include a clear disclaimer on Canvas about the workload. <br><br>The final exam was also pretty fair, and did a good job of spanning across the content of the course. All in all, decent course.",
                    "33": "Professor Molden is a great lecturer and makes the course interesting with a very structured schedule &amp; various interactive exercises. He also makes sure to post all of the lecture videos, which help a lot. However, the course load is VERY heavy compared to other 200–level courses. All the assignments are definitely interesting and intellectually stimulating, but they can be a lot because deadlines are so frequent.",
                    "34": "This class was a lot of work!!! Prof Molden warned us about this at the start of class and in the syllabus and it was no joke. I spent more time on this class than I would've liked. You are expected to prepare for each lecture by watching a multiple asynchronous videos and readings then writing two discussion posts and responding to four classmate responses per week. There were also two free response questions (max 2page double–spaced) due per week which were graded somewhat harshly and given no feedback. Some of the content was recognizable from Psych110, but for the most part the material was interesting. Still this course would've been much more enjoyable with a less intense workload."

                    "2": "This is a super fun and interesting class! Wendi is super engaging and the assignments aren't bad. The midterm is multiple choice and a few short answers/essay, and you do really need to review for it, but if you do you will be good.",
                    "3": "Take this class!! Wendi is such a good professor– she's super engaging, loves what she teaches, and is always willing and excited to answer any questions. Grades were composed of 2 team projects (short papers that weren't super difficult), weekly canvas mini–quizzes (3–5 questions, good prep for exams), and 2 non–cumulative exams (multiple choice, two short answers, &amp; 1 essay question). I truly cannot say enough how much Prof. Gardner is a joy to have in class– I'm always excited to see what she has in store for us, and she's always excited to share it :)",
                    "4": "TAKE THIS CLASS. Wendi Gardner is the reason I added a psych double major. This class was SUPER engaging and fun. There was a short quiz every other week but it was only 4 questions and open note. She made it really clear when you needed to read the text book and when you didn't. There were also two team papers, but they were not super difficult. She also offered MANY extra credit assignments. There was one midterm and a final, but if you attend lectures and take notes you should be okay. This was my favorite class this quarter. The topics were very interesting and applicable to my life. TAKE THIS CLASS!",
                    "5": "Great class. Prof Gardner is enthusiastic and knowledgable. Fair amount of grades – weekly short quizzes, team papers, extra credit opps, 2 exams. No need to read all textbook chapters, just the ones specified in syllabus. Class content is fun to learn about!",
                    "6": "I don't feel like there is a need to write too much. I am obsessed with Gardner. She is just incredible. If you are gonna to psych, trust me, take this class.",
                    "7": "TAKE THIS COURSE!! Professor Gardner is the most likable, knowledgable, and engaging professor I've had so far, and I'm definitely planning on taking more courses taught by her in the future. She is very familiar with the studies she's referencing, and cares deeply about all her students. She sprinkles in several extra credit opportunities throughout the course, and overall makes the content very interesting. There isn't that much reading required for this class, and I honestly think someone could get an A without reading the textbook at all. At the end of the last lecture, when professor Gardner was telling a personal anecdote to conclude the course, I literally could not stop myself from smiling the whole time. She's that good.",
                    "8": "I really liked this course! Wendi is clearly very passionate about social psychology and it makes the lectures and content interesting. Each lecture has a TON of information, which is difficult for exams (she expects you to pretty much memorize everything on the slides, which is a lot), but all of it is applicable to your own life. Although almost the full 80 minutes were taken up by Wendi talking the whole time, it felt pretty easy to stay engaged. She also clearly wants her students to succeed in her class and gives lots of extra credit opportunities throughout the quarter.",
                    "9": "Professor Gardner was always excited to teach her class. It helped to keep the class engaged and interested in the course material.  The quizzes are not too bad, just be careful with the wording because that one point off cant count for a lot especially if the quizzes are out of 4 –6 points. Still, there are many extra credit opportunities as long as you are present in lecture, you can take advantage of these.",

                    "11": "Wendi Gardner is a lovely human and one of the best professors I've had at Northwestern! Even though some of the material in this class is dense, she makes it fun and her lectures are always engaging. She includes fun photos and videos on her slides that relate to the course content and even tested some of the social psych studies on us during one of the lectures! The tests require a lot of memorization (which I found difficult since some of the topics were quite similar to one another) but despite the challenges from the tests, I really enjoyed this class and always looked forward to lecture.",
                    "12": "I love this class! The information we learned was so cool and really helped me understand myself and the people around me better. I definitely recommend this class to non–psych majors as well for this reason. The homework and exams were very reasonable as well. If you know everything covered in lectures and assigned readings you're good to go.",

This class is so interesting and I wish I hadn’t taken it with Orgo and Bio so I could have paid more attention to. But I ended with an A– putting effort just before exam day, so you will be fine. We learn a lot about romantic relationship, which was the 4 best lectures I had in my life. WG knows how to conduct a lecture and gather your attention.",

                    "17": "I love Professor Gardner, she's the absolute best! She is so sweet, passionate, funny, and a great lecturer. The workload for the class is pretty chill and consists of 2 non–cumulative exams (most of the questions are based on her lectures, and she indicates which portions of the textbook you need to read in advance), 2 group projects (which weren't too long), easy weekly open–note quizzes on Canvas, and a few opportunities for extra credit. The content itself is super interesting and very applicable to everyday life. Somehow this class taught me not just about social psychology, but about how to be a better person and friend to those around me. I highly recommend anyone to take this class with her!",
                    "18": "I took this class because I heard really good things. This class did not disappoint. Every lecture was super engaging and interesting. This was the first psych class that I took with only 2 exams so they were definitely more spread out with more time to study. There was a lot of content but you could get away with just studying the slides and the assigned sections. I appreciated the extra credit opportunities throughout the quarter!",
                    "19": "This class is great! The material is interesting, and you get to learn how to be a better person in society, which is a plus. The exams are straightforward and not designed to trick you at all, and Professor Gardner is wonderful. She does go pretty quickly, but she makes time for questions, and it's a lot of material. Nothing felt excessive, and it was all tied together really nicely.",
                    "20": "LOVED this class. A little more work than I anticipated and more work than it should be for a low 200 level. But the content is super interesting, and it is taught very well. Wendy explains all the concepts well and is very passionate and engaging. Would recommend anyone to take but don't think it's a super easy A",

                    "22": "took 110 w Gardner freshman year and loved it. 213 only cemented her place as one of the best psych profs at nu. Content given in a very straightforward manner, exam not made to trip you up",
                    "23": "This course was very fun, especially with Prof. Gardner. Although most of the grade was from the two exams, she gave plenty of opportunities to improve your grade. The content was very interesting and was taught very well.",
                    "24": "Wendi is the BEST! This is the second class I have taken with her and I cannot rave about her enough. She knows her stuff and is so passionate about the material that you grow to just love the subject too! There were two non–cumulative midterms and weekly open–note short quizzes. The group papers felt like they were a bit on a time crunch, but they were always so doable and challenged us to apply our knowledge. There are a generous amount of extra credit opportunities, and I have honestly never enjoyed a class more.",
                    "25": "super interesting course. dr. gardner is a fantastic lecturer and if you are interested in people/psychology in any way you are going to be fascinated by the things you learn in this class. exams are admittedly hard, but study hard and often and you'll be fine",
                    "26": "TAKE THIS CLASS! It's actually so fun and interesting. Wendi is the best lecturer I've had at Northwestern and her passion is so clear. There is no homework other than a weekly, open–note, take–home reading quiz that's only 3–4 questions. Assessments include two non–cumulative midterm exams and two group essays. The group projects might be a little intimidating if you don't' know anyone in the class, but make a friend or take this with someone you know and you'll be fine. Only having two exams means both cover A LOT, but the slides are so full of information and are put on canvas right after every class. If you study off of the slides well, you'll probably do great.",
                    "27": "Gardner was awesome, the tests were a little hard, as well as the weekly quizzes, but nothing you won't be prepared for. Overall, great class",
                    "28": "Wendi is such a good professor and just the nicest person. She is really good at providing relevant and memorable examples that relate back to course content. The readings are honestly not necessary but be sure to at least skim them and read through the key terms before each exam. And always go to lecture because the examples she uses and way she phrases things in class are often exactly what is on the exam",
                    "29": "This class is amazing. I learned so much. There was a lot of material on the exam, but the material is really interesting so it is enjoyable to learn.",
                    "30": "Prof Gardner is a great lecturer, also very responsive and understanding. Grade consists of two exams, two group papers, and several extra credit opportunities. You will do pretty well if you just pay attention during lectures and skim the recommended textbook chapters.",
                    "31": "this class was super interesting and i really learned a lot, however it is actually challenging and easier than you think to get a b+ or a– instead of an a, the questions on the tests can be kind of tricky. But Prof Gardner is super knowledgeable and a really interesting lecturer and I would definitely recommend this class",
                    "32": "I found this course to have pretty engaging material. There's quite a bit of it packed into the two exams, but it overall felt manageable given the short weekly quizzes on Canvas and the time you have to prepare. The two team papers aren't much of a hassle either. Would recommend to those with any interest in psychology or sociology.",
                    "33": "I loved this course!! Professor Gardner is amazing at lecturing I quite literally don't know how she does it and doesn't stumble even once while lecturing. I thought that the course content was really interesting, and that it was easy to recall content from class on the exams due to the questions resembling mostly everything taught in lecture. The class also doesn't really have a ton of work, just weekly short (3–5 question) quizzes, the midterm/final, and two group papers (each person contributes like a page of writing). Professor Gardner also provides a ton of extra credit opportunities which I think is really nice and generous. Overall, really recommend taking this class with Professor Gardner!!",
                    "34": "The text is kind of useless, but overall this class is great. Study the slides hard for the exams and you'll be fine. Professor Gardner is a phenomenal teacher and the content is super interesting.",
                    "35": "Take this class! The course is really interesting and applicable to everyday interactions. Professor Gardner also does a great job of keeping the workload VERY manageable while presenting a new material.",
                    "36": "Professor Gardner was truly the highlight of this course. Her lectures were very engaging and her passion for the subject really came through. I highly recommend this class if you have any interest in social psychology. The workload was very manageable. We had weekly miniquizzes on Canvas due every Sunday, two team papers, and two exams throughout the quarter. Professor Gardner also offered several extra credit opportunities. The exams are difficult but it helps to begin studying several days in advance.",
                    "37": "It was really easy to follow the course material. Professor Gardner did a really good job during lecture in breaking down topics and providing research examples as explanations for research findings. The team essays and exams were also graded fairly. Overall, it's a good introductory course into social psych!",
                    "38": "Wendi is amazing. Amazing lecturer, great course.",
                    "39": "This is an absolutely amazing class, and Wendi is an amazing professor – super nice, helpful, knowledgeable, you can ask her questions and just end up chatting forever. Every lecture is super interesting, ranging from topics like belonging to attitudes to prejudice to groupthink. Really interesting, while not being a heavy workload – only need to look at slides and read specific sections of chapters that Wendi tells you before exams (ends up being like 15 pages reading total for each exam). Group papers are rough if you don’t have a good group, but interesting enough to actually enjoy either way. Take this class if you are interested whatsoever in the topic, or need a chill but interesting class.",
                    "40": "Good class.  Gardner teaches about interesting concepts but sometimes her lectures can be boring.  Most of the time they are fun and interesting though.  At times, it feels like a vocab class where psychologists just assigned new words to concepts that are entirely common sense.  Pretty easy class though.  Just go through the slides and readings before the exam and you will do 90+ on the exams.  Two team papers that are really not much work at all.  Good distro class with interesting concepts taught.  Would recommend.",
                    "41": "Professor Gardner is one of the best professors I’ve ever had. Her friendliness and enthusiasm about the material made me genuinely excited to come to class every day. The course material is highly applicable to everyday life and very interesting – I would recommend this course to everybody, even if they are not a psych major.",
                    "42": "While I liked the content of the course I did not love how the assignments were set out. The group projects had a very short turnaround and were such a small portion of the grade it did not seem worthwhile. The first exam was also unnecessarily difficult and the TAs were not even able to explain the multiple–choice answers. That being said, Professor Gardner is a great lecturer.",
                    "43": "Professor Gardner is amazing. Take this class with her. She has several extra credit assignments. The team papers aren't the greatest, but they're not  that bad. The two exams are fine and there's no final. Take this class with her!",
                    "44": "I LOVED THIS CLASS!! Def take it with Wendi. I was interested and engaged in all the concepts we discussed and Wendi is a genius when it comes to Social Psych. You can hear the excitement in her voice every class. The only bad thing is that the 2 midterms are worth like 80% of the final grade and there is A LOT of memorization involved. We had weekly quizzes and 2 team projects but that's all!",
                    "45": "I loved this class! It was super interesting and applied very well to real life. Professor Gardner is an amazing lecturer and you can tell she cares a lot about her students.",
                    "46": "Overall a good psychology class. Professor Gardner is clearly very knowledgeable about the subject and gives lots of information on every topic. It does not require a lot of outside of class work except for the two team papers, which take a bit of time. Otherwise very manageable and fairly interesting.",
                    "47": "Wendi is an amazing professor who clearly cares about what she is teaching! The course is not very time consuming but is super interesting and you learn a lot about phenomena that seem unimportant! TAKE THIS CLASS!",
                    "48": "I really enjoyed this course! Professor Gardner teaches in an effective and engaging manner, and it was easy to follow. I also appreciated the structure of the course. It wasn't too demanding, allowing me to genuinely learn the interesting content.",
                    "49": "Overall good class, Professor Gardner is knowledgeable and nice. She answers any questions you have and replies to emails promptly. Her lectures are interesting and not boring.",
                    "50": "Very interesting course but heavy weight on the exams so study hard for them",
                    "51": "I highly appreciated that Prof. Gardner's slides were informational and easy to study with for exams and quizzes. She chose to expand on topics that she knew would be very appealing and compelling for us students, and also included many studies that helped enhance our understanding of topics.",
                    "52": "I LOVED this class!! It was so interesting and I learned a ton. For the most part, the workload is light with weekly quizzes. Group projects can be time consuming but enjoyable if you have a good group (I recommend taking the class with friends!). Exams are tough. I studied a lot for the exams (studying a full week in advance of the exam), yet I still did not do great on the multiple choice sections. However, the content is so interesting that I would still recommend taking it. Exam difficulty is definitely something to be mindful of, though."

The exams are 50–65 multiple choice questions, and they are not too difficult, but it is very important to attend lectures and study the slides. Not an easy A but a great class overall.",
                    "1": "I would recommend taking this course with Professor Bodenhausen, he is a very good lecturer and his slides are well put–together. Taking notes (~40 pages of reading per class) outside of class and one written assignment were the only homework. Tests were very fair.",
                    "2": "This is a pretty good 200–level psych class if you're a psych major. The content is really interesting and the exams are very fair as long as you study the lectures and do the readings.",
                    "3": "I loved the lectures for this class. The content was always interesting, and the specific studies we looked at could be very entertaining. I didn't feel like I needed to study too much to feel good in the exams. By reading the key concepts at the end of sections in the textbook and highlighting/being familiar with notes, I was confident.",
                    "4": "Solid distro for the School of Comms social sciences/ethics credit. My advice is to NOT read the textbook readings, as they actually make things more confusing. (I got much better grades on the second and third tests, after only reading the chapter summaries of the textbook instead of the whole chapters.) Only read the summary!<br><br>Course info was slightly less interesting than expected, but enough to engage me as a non–STEM major looking to fulfill a credit. Class is an easy A–/A if you pay attention in lecture and organize your study guides well ahead of time.",
                    "5": "This class wasn't a hard class but the exams were harder than the topics made it seem like as the questions were made to be tricky and readings also carried some importance in the exams.",
                    "6": "TAKE THIS CLASS! This class made me realize I wanted to double in psych. Because it's social psych, it covers concepts we're exposed to all our lives and provides new insight onso many common misconceptions we have about ourselves and the social world! It was so interesting. The exams are not too difficult (noncumulative multiple choice) , as long as you review your notes and just read the summary bullet points of each textbook chapter. Professor Bodenhausen strays from the slides a lot so make sure to pay attention in class.",
                    "7": "I learned so much but it was not an easy A like other people say...",
                    "8": "I enjoyed this course! The content was fun and easy to digest. Professor Bodenhausen is nice, but his lectures are pretty boring. The slides are pretty good and if you go to class you don't really have to do the readings. However, if you don't go to class the readings give you everything you need to know. There's 3 exams all multiple choice that are pretty easy (the final is harder than the midterms though). There's only one homework assignment that's easy and the rest of the points come from writing exercises in class (essentially attendance points). Overall its a good course to take, lectures are just boring.",
                    "9": "very interesting course learned a lot and not that difficult",
                    "10": "I overall enjoyed this class. I took the class because of a prereq for IMC and I think that the material learned in class can be applicable amongst many different subjects. I like how versatile the class is in this sense.",
                    "11": "I LOVED THIS CLASS! I think it is insanely interesting and applies to so many areas of life outside of a learning setting. Professor Bodenhausen is a straightforward lecturer, which at times can be boring, but if you're interested then you will be engaged. 3 tests and no final, all of which were pretty fair and straightforward. Some questions on tests were from readings so read the textbook or at least skim. No homework, as long as you take good notes in class you'll be perfectly prepared for tests. A lot of good research examples to help you understand topics.",
                    "12": "This class was great. The prof. is a great lecturer and is very organized. I learned a lot about social psychology, and the exams were very fair.",
                    "13": "This class is a lot of long lectures and readings. The professor speaks a little in a monotone voice so it is easy to zone out but as long as you make flashcards and study you will be just fine. No practice problems for the exams but they are all multiple choice.",
                    "14": "This course is really easy if you do the readings and take notes in class (and study). It's really only exams, so if you're reviewing the information as least two days before each exam, you should be fine. And the exams are not cumulative, so that helps too. <br><br>Attendance is sort of important as there's a writing exercise at the end of class that has to be turned in physically that contributes to a small–ish percent of your grade; but the exercises are not hard.",
                    "15": "I definitely recommend this class. The readings are super easy to get through and Prof. Bodenhausen is very organized and efficient. The lectures can be dull, but the slides give you all the information you need. Exams are just multiple choice, derived from the content you're given. Not an especially challenging or mind–blowing class, but still interesting, and definitely good if you need a lighter course on your schedule.",
                    "16": "Very informative but low stress.",
                    "17": "This was a pretty solid intro psychology class. Bodenhausen is a pretty good lecturer and his slides are very organized and comprehensive. Sometimes lecture feels a little long because he's a little monotone but honestly, the content is really interesting and he is a very organized professor. Attendance is technically taken, as you have to do a writing exercise at the end of each lecture for a point. Exams are pretty fair and straightforward, it's all MCQ and all you really have to do is study lecture notes and do the readings. There's no homework, and the only time you really have to do any work for this class is studying for the three exams. It's pretty low–stress and if you take good lecture notes, you'll be fine. I recommend it if you're looking for an interesting and chill psychology class.",
                    "18": "Tests mostly focused on lectures but there are textbook readings that go with it. I recommend skimming the textbook. Curves to the highest test score. Every class had a writing assignment but it was mostly if you wrote something down. So just show up to class.",
                    "19": "Go to lectures, take good notes, and study for the exam. Multiple choice and straight forward tests. Overall easy, prof is understanding of people with accommodations",
                    "20": "Grade is mostly based on 3 midterms, so study for those. He posts the slides, but I would advise going to class because there's a short writing assignment at the end of each one that gives you an extra point. 80% of the exam is based on content from the slides and the other 20% is based on the textbook. I would recommend this class! It's like zero work outside of class except for studying for midterms.",
                    "21": "He's an amazing lecture that kept me engaged, but his midterms can be tricky.",
                    "22": "The content is very interesting, I would say that all the questions on the exams are related to things said in class, so make sure that you're going to class and paying attention.",
                    "23": "This class was super easy and great if you are looking to fulfill a foundational discipline/distro requirement! Your grade is mostly comprised of your test scores from 3 multiple choice, non–cumulative tests. As long as you study the slides and skim through the readings for key terms/ideas, you should do well on the tests! There are a couple homework assignments throughout the course which take around 15 minutes max to complete. There is also a tiny writing prompt at the end of each class. It is just graded for completion! This class is an easy A and super applicable to everyday life! It is a very low time commitment and I could not recommend it more!!!",
                    "24": "Make your own quizlet that includes textbook terms and you will get an A.",
                    "25": "Not the most effective class to take if you have basic social awareness. Everything feels very intuitive, which can actually help with retaining information for tests. 3 tests throughout the course, all non–cumulative. Show up to get participation points with a very simple exit ticket at the end of class. Lectures can be long and hard to stay awake for, but the professor is very nice and willing to answer any questions.",
                    "26": "Very straightforward and interesting class –– learned a lot of interesting stuff about social psych. The professor is a little monotonous/not very engaging sometimes but the class content is super interesting. Overall would definitely recommend!",
                    "27": "It was a good course, but the instruction was boring at times.",
                    "28": "Course was interesting and exams were okay",
                    "29": "This is a really good distro as long as you show up to the lectures and take notes. The content is SO interesting and it's even fun when you really get past the first few introductory–ish lectures. All of the content is applicable to real life, so it makes it easier to actually understand the concepts and theories for the 3 exams (non–cumulative). Plus, one of the Tasks was super chill and actually had fun talking to students in office hours. Overall, would definitely recommend especially if you don't want to do math in a psych course.",
                    "30": "This class was super chill. The professor is a really good lecturer, and the content is super interesting, so it's not that hard to stay engaged the whole class. However, the class is not recorded, so it's heavily recommended that you go. The slides are really concise and sometimes can be confusing to understand / piece together if you weren't present for class. The exams were easy, around 50–65 multiple choice questions. If you go to class and take good notes, you'll do fine. He doesn't deviate much from what he says in lecture. The was also a single homework assignment that was meant to give students more points, and you also have a writing exercise each class to account for attendance. The textbook readings are supposed to be required, but most people don't do them. I would say there were about 5 questions from the textbook readings each exam, or there would be vocab from the textbook as answer choices for a multiple question, which could get a little confusing at times if you didn't know what the vocab word meant because you wouldn't be able to eliminate it. However, the stuff that he tests from the textbook readings are all vocab related, so what I did was just go through each chapter and make quizlets of all the vocab and I reviewed them literally the night before just to understand the vibes / general meaning of each word. But honestly, you can probably still get an A without doing the readings, as long as you're solid on the lecture material. This class was probably my chillest class this quarter because there's no regular homework aside from just studying for exams. If you review content as you go through the course and do some extra studying a few days before the exam, it's a breeze. And the content was super interesting, it's really relevant and applicable to your everyday life.",
                    "31": "I thought this class was pretty interesting overall. However, I felt like the lectures were generally a bit boring, as it was mostly Prof. Bodenhausen just lecturing at you. He also has a sort of calming voice, which definitely didn't help with that. I would recommend doing the readings, they help you know what class will be about and probably help you to be more interested and focused. I didn't do many of the readings because I had lots of readings from other classes too. The exams were all multiple choice, which was nice.",
                    "32": "This class is essentially all about going to lecture and studying for exams. Bodenhausen is a very good lecturer and you learn a lot, but lectures aren't particularly exciting or fun at all. The textbook isn't very important and if you study based on the lecture slides and outlines you will be more than prepared for the exam.  As a psychology course, you learn a ton and get exactly what you expect.",
                    "33": "Although very interesting topics, the lectures often felt a bit dry and not really engaging. The work was not too bad at all but I did have to study for the tests quite a bit, since your grade is heavily based on your performance on the 3 midterms.",
                    "34": "I think it was crucial to read the textbook for the tests, but I also studied pretty hard for these tests and didn't do well. I went to every class, did every assignment, and read every textbook page – I honestly think the questions may have intentionally been tricky....I'm not sure. It was a good class, very interesting, and necessary to take for a psychology major/minor, but I was disappointed in my performance even after I worked hard to do well.",
                    "35": "nope",
                    "36": "I really liked the course. There were only three exams, and there was no final. You don't really have to read the chapters unless you want to, and the material covered in the lectures was basically the content of the exams.",
                    "37": "I found this material super stimulating. Especially learning about attraction and aggression",
                    "38": "Great class. 3 MCQ exams. Go to lectures because the slides aren't enough information to do good on exams.",
                    "39": "This was a great class. Everything is very upfront with Bodenhaussen, and the content is really interesting.",
                    "40": "Great class. Boddenhasuen can be a little deadpan but I personally found him to be engaging and very clear with his descriptions (I am a psych major so maybe take that into account).  Lecturers included good studies and videos to back up what he was saying. Tests are very fair and simple if you learn the terms straight from the lecture and review the slides.",
                    "41": "I really enjoyed the course! It was clear Professor Bodenhausen was very passionate about the subject and wanted to ensure we all learned the material. I personally really liked that there was not much outside material we had to focus on. We really just had the 3 exams we had to study for. And if you reviewed the lecture slides and textbook readings then you would most likely do a good job. Attending lectures were also mandatory because there were in–class assignments you had to complete after each lecture. And also there was 1 homework assignment that was really straightforward. Overall, great class!",
                    "42": "The course was pretty interesting and has lots of cool research that is very up to date. Lectures are quite slow but it is a chill class as you only need to take notes on lectures, the slides are later posted and the exam is about the content. Professor is really understanding and does interesting research but it is a slow class.",
                    "43": "good low level psych class/distro, not too hard and professor is good at communicating information",
                    "44": "There are 3 midterm exams for this class, so make sure you study and do very well on them as that is what your grade is entirely based on. If you're taking a bunch of classes with 3 midterms I wouldn't recommend this class, as I found it very difficult to balance all of the exams. Because you only have these exams to make up your grade you need to do well on them or you won't do well in this class, so just keep that in mind. The professor is amazing and his lectures are super interesting though! I really enjoyed taking this class.",
                    "45": "This class is amazing, I loved the readings and lecture content. The professors can sometimes ramble or sound monotone, but otherwise, the TA's are extremely kind and helpful (and AVAILABLE), and there isnt ever homework. Only readings. Great class, I learned so much.",
                    "46": "I had a very very positive reaction to this class. The content was fascinating and taught in a very clear way. I had heard the professor wasn't engaging, but while his voice is slightly monotone, I thought he taught very well and helped me learn the material very clearly. And it feels like a very manageable amount of work while also teaching me a lot. I loved the content and the professor and would definitely recommend it to anyone who asked.",
                    "47": "My least favorite professor I have ever had at Northwestern. The professor often used class time to voice his opinions on the state of the world– very unusual and odd. The class material itself was fine and relatively interesting, but the professor's monotone unenthusiastic teaching combined with his need to insert his own \"takes\" was not conducive to learning. The exams were very easy, and although attendance is mandatory (daily writing exercises), I never felt I needed to take any notes throughout the quarter. Overall class felt like a large waste of time, and I wish I had taken it with a different professor because the topic could be super interesting. It was just a very unusual experience for a Northwestern course, normally I absolutely adore my classes, especially psych.",
                    "48": "This was a pretty good class. Prof. Bodenhausen's is very knowledgeable. The lectures were a bit monotonous and boring, but all the material was interesting. The class is also very manageable. We had 3 midterms (all non–cumulative), which were very manageable, and that was pretty much it. You don't have to do the readings because the only reading material that would show up on the exams was in the chapter summaries (so just read those before the exams). We did have to do a little writing exercise at the end of class, so you do have to show up to class, but those write–ups were just graded for completion, so not hard to do well on them. Overall a pretty easy class. As long as you study, you will do well on the exams.",
                    "49": "You have to come to class but if you do and take great notes and study before the exam, you can get an A.  There's class participation at the end of every class which can really make difference in your grade. Boring lecture. Really boring"

I went to office hours with one of the professors and followed everything I was told but still received major point deductions for minor errors. For project 3 we were very concerned as we had to come up with everything from the beginning. We met many times as a group along with on of the professors. Throughout the process we would email both professors separately and their answers would never align. The professors never seemed to be on the same page.

My section was lead by graduate TAs and they organized the class in such a way that didn't make the class feel too exhaustive or loaded with heavy work constantly. Don't get me wrong, you still need to put in the effort and work on the projects to do well in the class, but the structure broke down the process of completing each project into manageable workload and make the overall experience more digestible and easy to understand. Pay attention in class, go to office hours if you need more clarification, and be sure to put the effort into your work, and you should be good.",

                    "5": "Overall this course was great. The instructors were incredibly patient and more than willing to help, so no issue there. The class was a little slow and repetitive at times, but overall the material and content taught was useful for projects and papers.",
                    "6": "Deniz and Raul are really engaging and knowledgeable professors that are conducting research themselves. It is great to learn from people conducting the research that you are being taught about",
                    "7": "Good class, taught me a lot about how to write a research report and properly conduct research but a lot of the lecture content was just a review of basic information that is learned in almost every psychology class",
                    "8": "It definitely wasn't my favorite psych class but you have to take it so it wasn't that bad. Professor Uttal definitely helped us succeed and taught us a lot of interesting content. Very good introduction to a huge aspect of psychology.",
                    "9": "This class is easy in the sense of open note test and papers determining your grade but the grading is hard to understand and not done by the professor. You can get an A but you will have to put in a decent amount of work for the essays and prepare for the exams a little.",

                    "13": "This is a required course, and was relatively painless. There are three papers, but they aren’t graded too harshly, although designing the studies and writing the papers inevitably takes some work. It’s not difficult to do well in this class if you go to class, pay attention, take notes, and make some effort to participate, especially since exams are open note. Uttal is a bit aloof, a little quirky (odd), and somewhat disorganized, but in an affable way, and is a genuinely nice person who cares about students and wants you to succeed. He also gave us extensions at the end of the quarter, where paper 2, the group presentation, paper 3 and the final exam were happening one after the other. <br><br>I must say that classes sometimes felt like a fever dream, where I was the only one paying attention to him talk about a horse which did math or his dog getting a haircut and everyone else was playing 2048 or absent in the nice hot basement of Elder. Definitely one of the classes of all time",
                    "14": "i liked how the class taught us how to write a research study rather than just giving us tests",
                    "15": "I came into this class not excited because of what I've heard about Psych Research methods, but what I can say is that you should definitely take it with Mesghina if you can! She made the class so much more interesting and her enthusiasm really shows. The assignments were very doable, and we were able to work in groups on all of the assignments so I never felt alone. I learned so much and the grading was very fair.",
                    "16": "By the end of this class you will feel a lot more confident in your abilities as a researcher. Mesghina is also a great professor: she's caring, provides great feedback, and gives good lectures. Really enjoyed this class.",
                    "17": "Definitely take this with Prof Mesghina! There are three papers and two presentations, but it's all group work and well distributed. This isn't the class for you if you don't like group projects, but overall it was a super reasonable amount of work and very informative.",
                    "18": "Take this class with Prof. Mesghina!! She did the impossible and made this class actually enjoyable as well as insanely manageable. She is willing to help every step of the way, provides amazing feedback that helps in understanding how to actually write research papers, and is just an amazing, caring, and understanding professor overall. She gives out rubrics so you can know how exactly you will be graded. She cares more about you understanding the content and learning than the grades as well–– meaning she is incredibly fair in her grading. As long as you put in the work, you will be absolutely fine in this course, which cannot be said for other sections of Psych 205. Only three papers the entire class as well as a final presentation about the independent research project you conducted. If you have to take this class, do not take it with anyone else! Prof. Mesghina is the absolute best!!!",
                    "19": "It was very group work driven, and I had a fantastic group. Prof was great. While her grading was a tad nit–picky, she made it very easy for us to succeed.",
                    "20": "Mesghina is great! She is such a girl boss and I loved learning from her. All the essays were group essays, which was nice. Mesghina was super thorough with the structure of a good research paper. There were a lot of details expected from a paper that I didn’t know about before, but she’s really helpful in ensuring you understand and succeed.",
                    "21": "It is hard to get into Prof. Mesghina's research methods class, and for good reason. She does a fantastic job leading us through the process of creating a research paper, and paces the class in a way that the eventual 20+ page research paper doesn't seem so daunting. The class is entirely group–based, which I liked because I was lucky enough to get a wonderful group that worked and communicated well together. Prof. Mesghina is VERY thorough with her edits of your work. She makes you a much better writer, but make sure to try your very best with each draft that is subsequently submitted.  You can tell that she really cares about her students, and she made the class very rewarding.",
                    "22": "I loved this course with Professor Mesghina, definitely recommend you take it with her. She makes an overwhelming course really simple with her instruction and lesson plan/timeline.",
                    "23": "Professor Mesghina is a great professor, take this class with her. There are 2 mini papers and a final paper all are done in the same randomly assigned group. If you don't like to work in groups this isn't for you. The course had readings and some 1–2 question quizzes on them called learning exercises, but as long as you do them you get full credit. Professor Mesghina's class presentations and readings were very informative and closely related to what we were doing in our assignments.",
                    "24": "I love love LOVED this class. I had been dreading taking it due to past CTECS, but Professor Mesghina changed the entire game. She is so sweet and educated, and super helpful. She also made the class extremely enjoyable, and somehow transformed what would be complicated course materials into straightforward ones. She walks you through every step of the group paper, and has multiple draft submissions, so we really have the time to read and incorporate feedback. If you have to take this class (which psych majors do), TAKE IT WITH MESGHINA.",
                    "25": "I was nervous about this course because I had heard awful things about it.  I had tried to avoid taking it for the longest time!! Now, after taking it, I can tell you that it was not as bad as everyone made it out to be! I would highly recommend taking it with Professor Mesghina. She was a great professor and made me feel confident and capable of doing well in her class.  Unfortunately, if you aren't too fond of group work, this class is all group work. You will get paired with a group and that will be the people you work with all quarter. If something is off with your group, I would recommend talking to the professor about it from the very beginning, because your group dynamic is very important for your success in the class. If you are paired with a good group, you will most likely do great. It really helps to figure out everyone's strengths in the group when it comes to the different sections of the research papers.",
                    "26": "Great class! Learned so much about how to read/write research studies. I'm not looking to do psychological research in the future, but definitely a great skill to have. Levy Chung &amp; TA Mandy were incredibly helpful and accessible.  The class was mainly focused on learning to conduct and write up psychological research, which was a bit boring and involved a lot of long papers, but office hours were SO helpful with both the professor and TA. They really know what they're doing; take this class with them if you can!",
                    "27": "After hearing the horror stories of Research methods, I was weary of taking this class. However, Chung made it interesting for me. She is one of the very few teachers that care about the success of their students. She is willing to go over your papers and our TA, Mandy was extremely helpful as well. If you have the chance, I recommend taking Chung for Research methods",
                    "28": "Many people need to take this course for their degree, but Professor Chung is great. She really knows what she's talking about and is able to communicate everything/concepts very smoothly and gives great feedback for our assignments.  It's a research methods class so there is a good bit of work but nothing in this class felt like busywork.",
                    "29": "Chung is so very very detailed and puts a lot of time and effort into helping you with your assignments. Definitely go to office hours and you only really need to read the readings if you are not familiar with research at all. She is a pretty tough grader for assignments, but gives loads and loads of feedback which is helpful!",
                    "30": "it was hard, but I learned a lot. the grading is pretty harsh, but the feedback is very helpful. go to office hours because they will help you go over your paper in real time. the readings weren't all helpful, but lecture always was. the professor is very enthusiastic and willing to answer questions.",
                    "31": "Professor Chung is absolutely wonderful! Both her and our TA Mandy were incredibly helpful and responsive when it came to answering questions, giving edits on our writing, workshopping research ideas, helping us with statistics, etc. Grading is based on 4 1–page response papers, 3 research papers (the first two are partial research papers to help you practice for the third one which is full–length), and a group presentation; I found the grading to be very fair and got clear feedback on every submission. And no exams like some of the other sections! I've heard so many horror stories from friends about 205 so was a bit nervous heading into it, but Prof. Chung does her best to help you actually understand and enjoy what you're reading and writing about. Would definitely recommend taking this class with her if you can!",
                    "32": "Chung is a kind and responsive professor. She's always willing to talk or give feedback on work. The expectations are clear and the assignments are straightforward and helpful. It's very evident that she cares about the material and students. The work does require a lot of writing for research papers, but she lays it all out for you. In addition, the final is a group project to explore any question your group decides and then an independent research paper. This class will definitely give you an idea of if you like research or not.",
                    "33": "I really enjoyed learning how to create a research project of our own and Professor Chung was great at communicating the most important parts of the process.",
                    "34": "This class was more work than I thought it would be, the prof is very nice and provides good feedback for essay but she is a pretty critical grader",
                    "35": "Obviously research methods is a pretty dull topic but professor Chung was probably the best to take it with because she's a great lecturer and can actually make the material interesting.",
                    "36": "I was expecting this class to be boring and tedious but Prof Chung made this class amazing. She is extremely helpful and willing to grant extensions on papers and help review them. There is only a lot of work at the end of the quarter but if you space out the work, it won't be too bad. We read very interesting articles that relate to research in psychology and although I was not expecting to enjoy them, they were interesting. I highly recommend taking this class with Prof Chung as she is very kind and helpful.",
                    "37": "If you have to take this class, TAKE IT WITH CHUNG!!",
                    "38": "it was such a struggle to do work in a course i have absolutely no interest in whatsoever",
                    "39": "Professor Chung does a really good job trying to make this class as engaging as possible. This class is a decent amount of writing, it's easiest to do work early and try to get feedback.",
                    "40": "Alissa is the professor you want to take this class with! The course was structured very well, it builds you up to doing a study entirely on your own (and your group) piece by piece with guidance. I've learned a lot.",
                    "41": "I had head good things about this course and I was looking to fulfill another psych major requirement. The class started out fine, nothing to complain about.

She is truly the best ever, so understanding of people's varying levels of interest on the subject, and does her best to make the class as applicable as possible even for those not wanting to go into research. I was not looking forward to this class at all but genuinely was excited to come to this class every day. The layout of the class, which is group work heavy, is really nice because it allows you to collaborate with other peers on a subject that is most interesting to all of you. Really can't say enough good things about Prof M., and would 100% recommend anybody who needs to take research methods to take it with her.",
                    "3": "Prof Mesghina is the best––if you can take this class with her you should!! There is a lot of time in class to work with your group, which cuts down on outside of class time a lot. I like that the research is done in groups, but everyone writes their own papers, meaning your grade doesn't depend too much on the group you end up in. Papers build on each other and she has you turn in drafts, so the work ends up getting split up and never feels too overwhelming. Grading is based on papers and presentations only, no exams :)",
                    "4": "No one is too excited to take this course as it is a requirement, but Prof Mesghina makes it very enjoyable! We had 3 papers which we had lots of time to ask questions about in class and a group project which takes up most of the quarter. You are placed in groups based on a subject interest and then conduct your own mini research project and everyone presents the last two days of class. Definitely take this class with Mesghina!!",

You're put into groups at the beginning and you work on a lot of your assignments together which makes it a lot less daunting. The group project which you eventually write individual research papers about was also honestly very enjoyable. This class shocked me a lot by how much I actually enjoyed it and I would definitely say that was because of Professor Mesghina so definitely take research methods with her I know most other classes are much worse!",

                    "11": "Mesghina is the best! Despite originally dreading taking this required course, I actually had a lot of fun and learned so much. The task of conducting a psych study and writing an academic paper can sound really daunting, but Prof Mesghina does a great job at breaking the parts down and providing guidance and feedback every step of the way.",
                    "12": "Definitely take Psych 205 with Dr. Mesghina!! She is the best and somehow always manages to fuse funny comments into her lectures unintentionally, making this course especially enjoyable. She is so sweet, responsive, willing to get to know each of her students, and also successfully makes this class a fun learning experience.",
                    "13": "Loved methods with Mesghina!!! Amazing professor and made this dreaded class really bearable. She broke all projects/papers down into very manageable parts which made the whole class feel really simple.",
                    "14": "This course was a really good approach to research methods. While the topic of research methods can feel drab, this course made writing research papers and conducting research engaging. Professor Mesghina is wonderful– she wants you to do well in the course and actually enjoy writing/ learning about research. Everything in the class built on each other and flowed very well and nothing seemed unfair. I highly recommend it!",
                    "15": "Fantastic course with the best professor. Take this course. You will enjoy it and learn a lot about the research process.",
                    "16": "Not a fun class, but Prof. Mesghina makes it SO SO SO much better! Totally walks you through the papers so that you're chilling by the time Reading Week comes around!",
                    "17": "Absolutely enjoyed this course with Mesghina. She truly cares for students and gives great feedback that helps improve our papers step by step. Highly recommend taking it with her as you actually get to not only learn how to write each section and develop a research question but enjoy this course.",
                    "18": "Pretty standard course. I do think we got all the help we may have needed in understanding the topics and the papers felt very comfortable because of Professor Horton's presentations he gave which were super helpful.  The course was a good intro to research design and honestly had me questioning all studies I encountered from that point on which is kind of a cool mindset to be in.  All the exams were super fair and I felt I had plenty of time to complete them.",
                    "19": "I enjoyed the class and learned a lot about reserach methods in psychology, despite being new to the subject. Prof Horton was straightforward with the content and clarified things so things were easy to understand. He also went over what he expected from the papers before assigning them. There's a group project and presentation which was a good way to work with and learn from other students.",
                    "20": "This course isn't very exciting, but that's probably expected for a research methods class. It's fine– not too hard, topics are relevant if you want to do research.",
                    "21": "Felt it prepared me for future classes.",
                    "22": "I came into this class with no expectations and figured it would be relatively easy. Overall, the material itself isn't difficult to learn, but the papers can be a bit brain–numbing to write.",
                    "23": "Horton is great, but his class is so much harder than it needs to be. 3 papers, 2 exams, weekly assignments, a presentation. My friends that took this class with other professors only had 3 papers. Material is boring and lots of memorization, not horrible, but I would recommend another professor if possible.",
                    "24": "Great course! Take it with Prof. Horton, he is wonderful!",
                    "25": "This class is fine for a required research methods class. You probably have learned most of the content in other classes, but it is good practice for writing research reports. The readings are not helpful at all, as they are exactly what is discussed in class.",
                    "26": "this class is going to be fairly boring no matter the instructor, but prof Horton makes this class very straightforward and provides lots of resources to help you succeed in the class. definitely recommend taking this class with Horton for the psych major/minor requirement. you don't have to read the textbook to do well in the class, but it's certainly helpful if you need more clarity on a topic. as a psych major I was very much not looking forward to taking this class, but Horton made it so much more doable and way less annoying.",
                    "27": "Honestly not as bad as I thought it was going to be. The lectures are pretty dry and the two tests aren’t easy but they aren’t bad at all. Papers are graded fairly and it’s not too much work to get an A especially if you have taken some other type of research class because there will be a lot of overlap of material",
                    "28": "Prof Horton is solid for 205. He organizes everything well and explains all the important content effectively and clearly. There are 2 exams, 3 papers, and a bunch of weekly assignments, sounds scary but is actually very manageable if you had previous research experience. Don't expect to learn a lot of advanced stats in this course tho.",
                    "29": "Take this class with Professor Horton, he is the best! He tries his best to make the course engaging despite it being a relatively dull subject.",
                    "30": "This class is supposed to be a nightmare but it wasn't. Yes, it was a bit harder than your standard psych class, but Professor Sid is genuinely kind and made the workload very accessible. The class does pick up in pace in the end though so just stay up to date as best you can and you'll have a good experience. Take it with Sid!",
                    "31": "I haven't actually met anyone who has taken research methods simply because they want to, not because it's a major/minor requirement. So realistically, no matter what class you're in, you're going to probably be pretty bored, but if you're reading this CTEC it's probs because you actually have to take this class. In that case, just get it over with. If you can take it with the other prof, that is probably better. Professor Reber was fine, but he assigned a ton of unnecessary busy work–feeling assignments. We also had to be able to use R for this class?? That was pretty surprising for me, and it was super tricky to figure out. The exams were all pretty fair though. You could take them on zoom virtually, and they were pretty straight forward if you understood the material, so in my opinion the exams were pretty easy. Writing up the experiments was not, and it was pretty tedious. Reber was a nice enough guy, but he randomly called on people, even if they were clearly uncomfortable answering, which I felt was unnecessary. He also consistently ran 2–10 minutes over time EVERY class, which I just felt was really disrespectful of our time. Overall, this class was fine, but there were all my qualms with it.",
                    "32": "While the course, by nature, is not going to be incredibly interesting, allowing us to explore applying statistics to our own psychological research projects, and teaching us how to write APA–style reports is invaluable . After this course, I have felt so much more confident when proposing research ideas in my lab, and thinking critically about research findings and methodologies.",
                    "33": "The course is very boring. Definitely, the slog to get through it is hyped up to be. I don't think it is possible for this course to be too amazing, just try to take it with the best possible professor.",
                    "34": "TAKE THIS COURSE WITH REBER. If you're at least remotely interested in psych and research, this class will take that to the next level. I don't know what the previous ctecs were up to, but Reber is really not that bad. The textbook that he created is super digestible and actually super helpful in not only preparing for the test but also for applying the knowledge to the real world. The textbook lines up super well with the class sessions, too. He provides such detailed feedback on the writeups that you learn so much from. The 2 midterms are super easy if you just go to class. He cold calls, but that's actually helpful cuz it forces you to stay engaged. I just can't say enough how much I've learned from this course and how helpful Reber was. You can comfortably end up with an A– even an A if you just go to class and put in work once in a while.",
                    "35": "This class was ok, I think it is not hard to do well. I felt like the grading and rubrics for a lot of the assignments were very abstract, so I was confused a lot of the time. I did like how the methods you learn early on build. I think the first writeup is very important, as feedback from that will influence subsequent writeups. I also think the exams were pretty fair and easy.",
                    "36": "Loved this course. Most of the content was intuitive, but it was still interesting to learn new concepts and how to conduct and critique research. Assignments were chill and Prof. Reber is great.",
                    "37": "I was very surprised at the quality of this class. I was given the impression that Psych 205 was the worst class ever and that it was a pain in the butt. Yet, it's honestly so chill and easy. <br><br>I didn't have to take notes during class. I just sat there, listened, answered questions (beware though, Professor Reber likes to cold call from a randomized list every class, so if you aren't comfortable with that, you should avoid Professor Reber. I heard Mesghina is much better). <br><br>The exams are honestly fairy easy. Before each exam, we are given practice exams. As long as you do those and you do the textbook readings, it'll be a piece of cake. <br><br>Professor Reber sometimes manages to crack a joke or too so lectures are not too bad.<br><br>However, he is terrible at keeping track of time and will almost always run 10 minutes late. If you have a class right after, don't do that. <br><br>Overall, not a terrible class but keep in mind some of the logistics of this class.",
                    "38": "Although this course was a major/minor requirement, it was helpful in teaching me how to conduct research and write psychological papers. The class wasn't overwhelming and with studying, it was not overly difficult.",
                    "39": "This course had a lot of assignments: homework assignment due every class, 2 exams, and 3 reports. The professor cold–calls, so be sure to understand the homework assignments. They are not too difficult or time consuming. Exams are extremely fair, and you will do well if you complete practice exams and do the reading. The reports, on the other hand, felt extremely ambiguous. I wish we were given more detailed instructions and a rubric. I felt like I followed all of the instructions, yet got points off for lack of detail. If instructions were clearer or we were given examples, I think I could have done better.",
                    "40": "It was an insane workload and I feel like it didn't need to be that much work. I stayed up until crazy hours many days of the week for this class. One time we had a final project due and Prof. Reber still gave us a full assignment to due plus an extra research paper to read and answer questions about. I feel like he could have organized it better so we wouldn't be as stressed. I did learn a lot about time management through it and the topics we learned did get me excited about research in the future. It was generally pretty interesting.",
                    "41": "I think this course was pretty interesting and I enjoyed the examples we talked about in class, but a lot of times it seemed that we spent too much time on examples on not enough time on the concepts that we had to know for exams.",
                    "42": "Chill class for the most part, just sucks because it's not interesting at all and the final project is a pain",
                    "43": "Class has three weekly assignments based on readings, a couple major writeups, and a final experiment. Don't take this course and expect an easy A. That said, Reber is a great, understanding professor who's chill and funny.",
                    "44": "This course was fine. It definitely wasn't enjoyable, but I do think that the topics covered are important and useful. Take it, put in the work, and get the most you can out of it.",
                    "45": "Professor Reber runs the class through cold calling, which takes some time to get used to. However, this forced me to pay attention and actually helped talking through unclear concepts. Each class starts by talking through the methodology of a research project, which eventually makes this process easier. A lot of the content is intuitive, so it is not extremely hard, but requires a bit of critical thinking. The homework for every class is a ~5 question problem set based on the chapter reading (one chapter per class), which takes 0.5–1hr.",
                    "46": "Prof. Reber taught that class in an interactive way which gave us an opportunity to engage with the context both during class and outside of class.",

                    "1": "Because this is a major/minor requirement, it obviously is not the most exciting class, but at least Professor Smith is aware of that, and he makes the class as interesting as he can. Smith is also very eager to help answer any questions students have, and is pretty flexible in scheduling time to do so if you can't meet during official office hours. While all professors say that they are available to answer students' questions, a lot do not actually mean it. However, Professor Smith certainly DOES mean it, as he is always advertising his office hours/willing to answer emails.",
                    "2": "Take this class with prof HDS! 205 is probably the worst psych class because it's not focused on a particular subject and therefore not that interesting, but it is something you just have to get out of the way, so I would recommend taking it with prof HDS because he is very chill and makes class bearable and engaging.",
                    "3": "Prof Smith is very kind and always willing to help. The material in the course was a little dry, but I think he did his best to try and make it interesting. I felt like the combination of exams (2) and papers (3) was a little much, but I found the grading to be fair and reasonable.",
                    "4": "This class was not as difficult as I thought it was going to be. While it is not necessarily the most interesting, Professor Smith is clearly very passionate about the material which helps. He is also super kind and willing to meet with students outside of class. Exams were not hard and study guides were provided.",
                    "5": "It was a good class but I wouldn't take it if I didn't have to. We got to do a lot of hands on work with research and research papers and we learned a lot through class lectures. Only thing is for group projects he selects your group for you which made it a little bit difficult.",
                    "6": "Like 201, it's just something you have to do, but Smith makes it a bit less painful. I like his slideshows and the class wasn't too much of a time commitment while also introducing you to the ropes of research design. Best thing I learned was how to read/write psych papers!",
                    "7": "This course was fine, there is just a crazy amount of group work (which could either be good or bad depends on the group). Also, it has both exams and papers, which becomes a bit hard to juggle.",
                    "8": "Professor Smith is a very reasonable professor, but the contents of this class are simply dull and uninspiring.",
                    "9": "This was a fine class. I wasn't too excited to have to take it but the professor made it enjoyable. He's very understanding and helpful, really willing to answer questions outside of class and find time to offer meaningful support to students. He is very kind and really didn't shame me or make me feel bad when I didn't understand something, rather, he took the time to help me and offer suggestions that actually improved my understanding. I was very impressed by him. Not my favorite class in general but it has to be done! I will say I think having 3 papers and 2 exams is a little much, especially when the longest (and hardest) paper is due the same time as our final exam.",
                    "10": "Any methods class is bound to be not the most interesting, but Professor Smith did a good job of explaining concepts and being super helpful in terms of data analysis and projects. There were 2 midterms (super reasonable) and 3 papers that were fine but felt really cramped towards the end of the year since they were backloaded. Pretty good overall, but the timing of the course could be improved. Professor Smith is a sweetheart.",
                    "11": "Professor Smith is really kind and definitely knows the content he is teaching. However, he is not an amazing lecturer or educator. He kind of assumes that everybody has previous knowledge in stats and already understands how to interpret data, so Professor Smith doesn't really teach the important things well (how to analyze data and interpret what the tests mean). Even when I asked questions, he was very vague and just didn't seem to answer the question directly. I personally was not a fan of his teaching and just did not learn very well from his lecturers. He is really nice, but I don't recommend this specific class with him.",
                    "12": "This course is a requirement, but it really needs to focus on how to write a research paper or else it'll be hard based on what you simply weren't taught.",
                    "13": "The professors were really nice! However, some of the feedback in this course felt very arbitrary and we had little feedbacks, guidelines or examples to go off of for assignments. Overall, this isn't the greatest section of Psych 205 but getting a decent grade is still manageable!",
                    "14": "this course is literally mount everest. very difficult to get a grasp of if you're not consistently going to class AND office hours or working with other students. don't recommend taking unless its a requirement",
                    "15": "Research methods sucks, we get it. But please, just work with us! Taking the course with the TAs is just luck of the draw. Diana was great, Ellyn was so strict.",
                    "16": "The grad students were great! I loved how they invited fellow grad students to talk about their area of psychology, research, and their path to grad school.  Although, I do think that some aspects of the class were a little unreasonable. I was fine since I've taken AP Stats and used R before, but I felt like the course sped through these topics and expected students to grasp them with little explanation. Some students were definitely lost because they've never been introduced to R or coding before.",
                    "17": "I felt this course was terrible.. I felt the grading was unfair, as a different TA graded each persons papers. The expectations were out of the water, with paper quality, assignment quanity, and quizzes. We often had very little time to write papers or complete assignments/projects. The quizzes were often short with very specific questions, yet we were&nbsp;told to study a handful of chapters to prepare.",
                    "18": "This class sucked. I have to take it for my major and the graduate students teaching this course made it SO challenging. They never provided rubrics and docked points off for things that we were never taught. You could tell that they didn't want to be there, making each class incredibly boring. Even when you would go into OH and look over your paper, while they were grading they docked off points for things that they never pointed out to fix. This class was incredibly frustrating because it felt like however much work I put in, and I put in a lot, I was going to get a bad grade no matter what.",
                    "19": "This course was great. Professor Perez and Butler were very precise in covering information on course topics. If you pay attention in class (and do the readings), the quizzes aren't hard at all. Additionally, they invited different graduate students to talk about their experiences, which was really helpful in determining what further actions can be done to further one's career. However, I think if anyone decides to take the course, don't drag on assignments (e.g. papers). The papers are thoroughly checked and graded; and the final paper is a huge assignment and the assignment feels really close. <br><br>If you ever have any trouble with assignments definitely go to office hours. The professors are really helpful with code writing and paper writing, and they're happy to lend a hand.",
                    "20": "For someone who loves psych but not research, this is not the most riveting material. However, it's not hard to do well if you start papers early, spend sufficient time on everything, and get help if necessary. They are pretty reasonable with deadlines except for the final, do not turn the final in late!! The research content we learn is pretty basic and a lot of it will be prior knowledge (biases, sampling procedures, basic statistical analysis etc)",
                    "21": "Didn't love this class but  it is unfortunately a must–do for psych...<br>Lectures were not particularly engaging, projects were tedious and not really linked to class content...",

                    "23": "This course provided a good introduction to psychological research. The content is not difficult––you either need to read the textbook OR pay attention to the slides. The papers can be long and sometimes frustrating but are a pretty fair assessment of our learning and are graded well. Going to office hours can be helpful. Class can be boring and not necessarily enjoyable, but overall not bad.",
                    "24": "I was pleasantly surprised by this course. After reading CTECS, I thought this would be a mundane class as a requirement for my major. But Professor Miller was a great instructor who stimulated my interest in the subject while offering support throughout the process.",
                    "25": "It's a requirement but Prof Miller is really nice and teaches well. He brought us cookies many times and was extremely helpful with papers and final projects.",
                    "26": "If you get the chance, take this class with Gregory Miller. He is a very fair lecturer who will help you a lot along the way. I heard horrendous things about this class, but with him, it was very manageable. There were four papers but only the last two were full papers. He is very helpful with the statistical analysis and for the final project he makes the people in class participate in your studies which is nice. The only homework you ever have is writing the papers.",
                    "27": "Overall this course wasn't too enjoyable but it was manageable. I've heard pretty terrible things about research methods, however this class was honestly a breeze. There are only 3 big assignments and other than grinding on each of them for a few days I never had much work for this class.",
                    "28": "This class was not as bad as I thought it was going to be. Professor Miller is definitely made it a lot less daunting. There are not specific rubrics for the essays, which was made them feel a big vague, but there are some parts of the essay that he basically writes for you and if you look at the slides and pay attention to what he says it shouldn't be too hard. (if you forgot a lot of things from stats don't worry, he will tell you what to put in the results section) He is also quite helpful during the final project/essay.",
                    "29": "Despite the reputation of this class, I actually found it to be quite useful and extremely applicable to the psychology degree. The first two papers were based on studies that were conducted in class, and Professor Miller walked us through every step of each section. Although the papers could be tedious at times, the expectations extremely clear and Blaise and Professor Miller was always happy to help. The final paper required us to design our own research studies in pairs, but we were given ample time so it didn’t feel too overwhelming. I would definitely recommend taking this class with Professor Miller!",
                    "30": "This course provided in–depth teaching about research methods in a digestible way that helped me understand the content",
                    "31": "There's 3 papers and a \"project proposal.\" The project proposal is a group research project where you come up with a plan together and then perform an experiment with other members of the class. The first paper is very short. They're all scientific research papers, so methods, results, discussion, etc. Pretty easy class if you know how to write one. There were textbook readings but that's not necessary. Just go to class and write the papers and you'll be good.",
                    "32": "This class gets a bad rep but it was truly fine. Prof Miller is so nice and a good instructor. I would def recommend taking with him. don't take tests just have 2 papers a short proposal for a study you conduct and then a final research paper on that study. so on the weeks where you don't have to turn those in the class is chill. the papers aren't too bad but the last one can def be more challenging because you have to find your own supporting research. i think the only criticism is sometimes the class feels a bit disorganized / unclear? sometimes things are posted on canvas but not mentioned in class in my opinion. so just make sure to stay on top of all requirements and resources. but you will be fine taking this class! we had a great TA too blaise which probably also impacts your experience in psych 205",
                    "33": "Since it's a requirement, you will probably just have to do it anyways. Professor Miller is nice and is happy to help, but the course content is just a little basic. There isn't a lot of consideration made for ethics and cultural implications, so I wish there was more.",
                    "34": "Not as bad as I expected! Professor Miller made the course a lot more interesting and less intimidating. The course was graded based on three writing assignments. I learned a lot about writing a formal psychology research paper.",
                    "35": "The papers can definitely be time consuming, but Prof. Gorvine tries his best to give you tons of materials and also scales it back if he notices students are struggling to meet deadlines. Had to ask for my first extension of college in this class, but luckily he is very understanding and kind about it! Try your best to get the lit. review done early (it will make your life so much easier when you have to finish the rest of the paper).",
                    "36": "I hated this class, but I don't think it's Prof. Gorvine's fault. It is just so much work and it is so overwhelming. Made me rethink my Psych major for sure. Make sure to take easier classes along with this class. You won't have time for anything.",
                    "37": "Gorvine is such a kind professor and I would definitely recommend taking 205 with him!",
                    "38": "honestly enjoyable if you are someone who derives gratification from your work. You get what you put into this class, but the research papers. though difficult and extremely time consuming, were awesome deliverables to have at the end of the quarter",
                    "39": "Prof Gorvine is the best person ever to take this class with. He made it very adaptable based on what we were working on in the quarter. He is super responsive when you ask him for anything. He gives so much structure and instruction when doing the big writing assignments which made it less daunting.",
                    "40": "lots of paper writing, so it was good practice, dr gorvine was really nice and willing to help",
                    "41": "Professor Gorvine is a very understanding professor and really cares about the success and wellbeing of his students. There are A LOT of assignments to keep track of so it is important to stay on top of the work since there is usually a paper due almost every other week. Gorvine grades fairly but his lectures in class can be rather boring. I recommend starting all of the research reports about a week before the due date since the writing process can be very lengthy.",
                    "42": "I feel like I learned more about research. Maybe I'm still confused about stats. But that's okay.",
                    "43": "Even though I did not want to take this class, Prof. Gorvine made it doable. He is super nice and very understanding while very much aware that this isn't the most fun course for everyone. I recommend taking it with him because he is engaged in it. 3 research reports increase load each time, and two other small papers must be done. You have to take this class, so do yourself a favor and take it with him!",
                    "44": "This class was really not as bad as the reputation is! Gorvine is a great professor, and the work was manageable. The last project is a bit rushed, but still not horrible.",
                    "45": "This class is so boring and unnecessary. It feels like we're just writing non–stop and the prof and TA try very hard to take off points from everything. Obviously none of the papers I write are gonna be perfect and it's impossible to get an A in this class. Gorvine is nice but the class is just so bad.",
                    "46": "Professor Gorvine is the actual best! This course was not nearly as painful as it could have been with a different professor.",
                    "47": "Kind of boring but necessary class. Definitely feel way more confident about what research even is and how I would go about getting involved in doing research in the future. Would DEFINITELY recommend taking the class with Prof. Gorvine if you can. He is so understanding and flexible and does his best to make the class as painless as possible.",
                    "48": "Professor Gorvine is really great and understanding! He will basically always give you extensions and he's not too harsh of a grader. Just wants everyone to do well! You never have to do the nightly readings.  You can  write all papers and get an A without them.",
                    "49": "Take it Professor Gorvine. He's amazing and super nice. There might be a lot of writing but the class is worth it",
                    "50": "Professor Gorvine is really kind, understanding, and always willing to help. I think a lot of the time, I honestly didn't know what was going on because a lot of what we learned in lecture or practiced during class in groups wasn't super relevant to helping us actually complete the graded work that we had to submit. However, they were still important to cover, I guess. The second research report can be really intimidating, but Professor Gorvine is so open to questions, so if you just plan ahead and go to office hours with all your questions, you'll have a much better idea of what to write / how to write the paper. All in all, this wasn't the funnest or most interesting course I've ever taken, but I am glad I took it with Gorvine. You'll make it through.",
                    "51": "this course is literally mount everest. very difficult to get a grasp of if you're not consistently going to class AND office hours or working with other students. don't recommend taking unless its a requirement",
                    "52": "Research methods sucks, we get it. But please, just work with us! Taking the course with the TAs is just luck of the draw. Diana was great, Ellyn was so strict.",
                    "53": "The grad students were great! I loved how they invited fellow grad students to talk about their area of psychology, research, and their path to grad school.  Although, I do think that some aspects of the class were a little unreasonable. I was fine since I've taken AP Stats and used R before, but I felt like the course sped through these topics and expected students to grasp them with little explanation. Some students were definitely lost because they've never been introduced to R or coding before.",
                    "54": "I felt this course was terrible.. I felt the grading was unfair, as a different TA graded each persons papers. The expectations were out of the water, with paper quality, assignment quanity, and quizzes. We often had very little time to write papers or complete assignments/projects. The quizzes were often short with very specific questions, yet we were&nbsp;told to study a handful of chapters to prepare.",
                    "55": "This class sucked. I have to take it for my major and the graduate students teaching this course made it SO challenging. They never provided rubrics and docked points off for things that we were never taught. You could tell that they didn't want to be there, making each class incredibly boring. Even when you would go into OH and look over your paper, while they were grading they docked off points for things that they never pointed out to fix. This class was incredibly frustrating because it felt like however much work I put in, and I put in a lot, I was going to get a bad grade no matter what.",
                    "56": "This course was great. Professor Perez and Butler were very precise in covering information on course topics. If you pay attention in class (and do the readings), the quizzes aren't hard at all. Additionally, they invited different graduate students to talk about their experiences, which was really helpful in determining what further actions can be done to further one's career. However, I think if anyone decides to take the course, don't drag on assignments (e.g. papers). The papers are thoroughly checked and graded; and the final paper is a huge assignment and the assignment feels really close. <br><br>If you ever have any trouble with assignments definitely go to office hours. The professors are really helpful with code writing and paper writing, and they're happy to lend a hand.",
                    "57": "For someone who loves psych but not research, this is not the most riveting material. However, it's not hard to do well if you start papers early, spend sufficient time on everything, and get help if necessary. They are pretty reasonable with deadlines except for the final, do not turn the final in late!! The research content we learn is pretty basic and a lot of it will be prior knowledge (biases, sampling procedures, basic statistical analysis etc)",
                    "58": "Didn't love this class but  it is unfortunately a must–do for psych...<br>Lectures were not particularly engaging, projects were tedious and not really linked to class content...",
                    "59": "This course provided a good introduction to psychological research. The content is not difficult––you either need to read the textbook OR pay attention to the slides. The papers can be long and sometimes frustrating but are a pretty fair assessment of our learning and are graded well. Going to office hours can be helpful. Class can be boring and not necessarily enjoyable, but overall not bad.",
                    "60": "It was a requirement and some of the content was interesting. The professors were kind, and I really enjoyed guest speakers. But the three projects we had to do were very difficult.",
                    "61": "This course is a requirement, but it really needs to focus on how to write a research paper or else it'll be hard based on what you simply weren't taught.",
                    "62": "The professors were really nice! However, some of the feedback in this course felt very arbitrary and we had little feedbacks, guidelines or examples to go off of for assignments. Overall, this isn't the greatest section of Psych 205 but getting a decent grade is still manageable!"

It’s the type of class where if you go to lectures and study the slides, you will do well on the two exams. Additionally, the writing assignments were short and sweet, making this class a bearable, enjoyable experience.",
                    "1": "Professor Nusslock is incredible. He gives such interesting and fun lectures that are full of fascinating content. He frequently ties complex neural processes to everyday activities so the dense parts of the class are still interesting.",
                    "2": "Good class! 85% of grade is based off of 1 midterm and 1 final, but if you study the slides, they're easy.",
                    "3": "I loved this course! Getting into the neuroscience of concepts I had learned in other psych courses gave me a significantly better understanding of them. Best of all, Professor Nusslock made the otherwise complicated course content accessible without sacrificing any of its complexity or meaning. I cannot say enough good things about this course, and highly recommend taking it, especially with Professor Nusslock!",
                    "4": "This is literally the BEST class I have had at Northwestern. I enrolled in this class with absolutely no prior knowledge in biology/physiology/neuroscience and end up enjoying it.",
                    "5": "You learn a lot in this class, but the content is interesting. Do not cram the material though! There are 2 exams with significant weight, which is the only thing that makes this class scary. Professor Nusslock is great! He's a great lecturer, willing to be vulnerable with his students, and very knowledgeable. He also makes sure that anyone who wants to take neuroscience even if they aren't on the waitlist can get in which is so so nice.",
                    "6": "TAKE THIS CLASS FOR A NATURAL SCIENCE DISTRO!!! The CTECs are not lying. Robin really cares about students succeeding (the average on the midterm was a 93%...I'm an Econ major and that literally is unheard of). He holds review sessions before the midterm/final and goes over any questions.....and lowkey gives hints on what the short answer questions will be. Grade made up of 3 short papers (5% each), 1 midterm (40%) and 1 final (45%). Questions really are based off of lecture slides which is so nice.",
                    "7": "This class was great! The lectures are engaging with great slides and interesting content. There is very little work outside of lectures, only 3 small writing assignments for the entire quarter. The exams were also done well, they're very straightforward and explicitly cover the lecture content. You will know everything on the exam so long as you read/take notes on the slides and do the assigned readings. Great class to get a science distro with, not stressful whatsoever and not boring either.",
                    "8": "Excellent nat science distro and Nusslock is just hilarious and so fun. The material is really engaging and he is an amazing professor. Highly highly recommend.",
                    "9": "I loved this course. Professor Nusslock is a magnificent teacher and a great lecturer. It is obvious that he cares about the subject and through that is an incredibly engaging lecturer. There are three papers for the class which are not very time consuming at all. We had one midterm and the final. As long as you study the slides you will be prepared for the exam. It is A LOT of content you're expected to know for the exam, so if you're not interested in this subject studying for these exams may be difficult. I could not recommend this class enough though!",
                    "10": "The best course I have taken at northwestern so far. The teacher is amazing and really passionate and manages to convey the information in a really clear and straightforward way which I understood perfectly without any background in biology. Two non cumulative exams composed of multiple choice and short essays which you can easily nail by learning the slides. Please take this class, especially for natural science distribution requirement as I learned so interesting facts about the brain, which somewhat impacted my perception of the world.",
                    "11": "Robin Nusslock is such a great lecturer: funny, engaging and willing to answer so many questions from students.  While the midterm being worth 40% of our grade was really daunting, it was structured in a very straight–forward way that all you really need to do is study the slides (1 or 2 mcq questions are from the textbook, honestly you don't need to do the readings to do well in this class). You learn a lot in this class but it's definitely worth it.",
                    "12": "great class, although you have to really study for the midterms and final, the tests are no surprise. All questions are based on lecture and readings so just study slides and you will be 100% fine.",
                    "13": "this course was interesting but can be a little hard ti understand the vocabs.",
                    "14": "This class is really dense but it moves at a good speed. You are graded on 3 short assignments that take an hour each, one midterm exam, and one final exam. If you study and crunch and cram to memorize all the concepts and all the information a week or a few days before the exam you will learn a lot and do well. I recommend taking this class. Professor Nusslock is also very passionate.",
                    "15": "This class was great if you love learning about the brain and psychology, but, honestly, I am not super super passionate about that and mostly did this for the distro, so this class could be reallyyy painful and have a ton of memorization for me personally. The entire class is on two exams you need to study a lot for. The prof was super kind and helpful and exams straightforward if you study, but it can be painful to memorize literally over 500+ slides before the exams.  LOTS of memorization –– don't take unless you are willing to literally make a 600+ flashcard Quizlet and study that religiously for like 5 days before exams in a cubicle in Main. Painful, but you will learn a TON and the prof is really thoughtful and passionate. Changed my whole understanding of how my brain worked, so, overall, this class has been well worth it.",
                    "16": "Take this class!!! Nusslock is a wonderful professor; he breaks everything down so well and he makes it very interesting. Easily one of the best classes I've taken here.",
                    "17": "good class. memorize slides and you'll be fine on exams, pretty straightforward. exams are worth 85% so a good amount",
                    "18": "There is a lot of content in this class, but Nusslock is a great professor that makes the lectures interesting. The 3 assignments are super easy and besides that, there are only 2 exams total. Review sessions before exams are helpful to get a deeper understanding of the content.",
                    "19": "Great professor, great class, makes you interested in neuroscience even if you didn't have a lot of interest to begin in. Workload is minimal as readings are pretty much optional and you just have three easy 2–page writing assignments throughout the quarter.  Exams are pretty easy if you are on top of the materials (median was 91 for the first exam).",
                    "20": "This class is manageable and good for the psych minor requirement. There is pretty much no work other than the midterm/final. I never did any of the readings, the exams are just on the lecture slides. I had to grind during exam season for this class just because it's so much content but if you study you will be 100% fine. Didn't love this class b/c the content is kind of boring but it fulfilled the requirement and wasn't too hard.",
                    "21": "Good interesting course but it's SO content–heavy. Do not take it as an easy distro. The midterm is worth 40% and final 45%, then there's three writing assignments.",
                    "22": "GREAT SCIENCE DISTRO! Professor Nusslock is so passionate about what he does, it really reflects in his teaching. The material is so interesting and applicable and not too hard to follow even if you aren't a huge science person. Nusslock goes beyond what you need to know for the course and talks about interesting fun facts and experiments. He will always answer our questions even if its just related to the brain. Most of this class is memorization for the two midterms. Everything is on the slides so all you have to do is study them. Attendance is not mandatory and everything is on the slides, but I would recommend going to class and you won't have to cram for the midterms. The first exam is 40% of your grade and made for the class to be successful. I studied for it a normal amount and went to class and got 100%. Its 50 multiple choice and a couple short answer questions. The second exam is 45%. It is non–cumulative but still during finals week. The other 15% is split among three writing assignments, mainly just for participation, you will get 100%. You find a video/article/experiment outside the course about the brain and write a summary, analysis, and connect it back to the course in 2 pages double spaced. Super easy, not very time consuming, and only happens three times the quarter. There are readings for each course, but the texts are just to help you understand the class and there are at most two questions on the exams where you would only be able to find them in the textbook. I wouldn't buy the textbook because it's so expensive. If you want it and can't afford it, the Professor is super understanding and will find you the resources to get it. Overall this is one of the best and not too hard classes I have taken at Northwestern. Take it if you can!",
                    "23": "Good class, very interesting, digestible content and the exams weren't too hard.  The second exam was def. harder than the first one.",
                    "24": "Take this class!! I am a psych major but am more interested in the social side than the science–heavy classes, so I was dreading having to take this class. But Prof. Nusslock is a great lecturer and made the class so interesting. It's an easy A if you just memorize the slides for exams, but beyond that I really enjoyed this class and learned a lot about applying science to psychological topics.",
                    "25": "This was a really good class and a solid science distro! Robin is a great lecturer who makes the material interesting and relevant. The exams were super doable if you study – it's mostly memorization and they aren't out to trick you. I liked this class a lot!",
                    "26": "I, overall, really liked this course. If you do the readings and memorize the slides the exams are very doable. I learned a lot about the brain in a very short time. I do wish we had moved a little faster through the content though.  We never got to the last two lectures which was sad because they sounded very interesting.",
                    "27": "Dr. Nusslock is one of the best professors I've ever had at Northwestern, I genuinely looked forward to every lecture and I appreciated how his grading system worked.",
                    "28": "Great Course! Prof Nusslock is a fantastic professor who conveys his passion in the subject and our success in each class. Content was taught in a very clear manner and facilitated our learning. Class consists of 2 non–cumulative exams and 3 2–page papers. Excellent natural science distro too.",
                    "29": "This course covers a LOT, and it also moves very fast. It's difficult to catch up once you've fallen a bit behind. The exams are easy as long as you study the slides, but there is a lot to memorize so they can be demanding depending on how well you've kept up.",
                    "30": "learned so much in real world sentences of caffeine, drugs sleep, supplements GREAT! teacher so passionate and great. he gives super easy papers that boost ur grade and find something ur interested in! captivating guy and straightforward test no tricks or gimmicks",
                    "31": "The material is interesting but lectures DRAG on cause people keep asking off–topic or personal questions. Makes it difficult to stay engaged, which sucks cause I feel like the prof actually cares :/ but attendance isn't required and the material is decently straightforward",
                    "32": "Great class. Nusslock is awesome and a great lecturer. Review sessions are super helpful. Plus if you've taken AP bio or any bio class the first half of the class is mostly review.",
                    "33": "Nusslock is great! Not a throwaway class but not too much work either",
                    "34": "Definitely recommend this class to anybody looking for a science distro! Professor Nusslock is a really engaging lecturer (among the best I've had at Northwestern) and the exams are designed to be fairly easy if you memorize all the slides (although there is a lot of content)",
                    "35": "great course, i learned so much and prof nusslock is a great lecturer. go to class, take notes, and then a few days before put in a lot of studying and you'll be fine, i did that for the first exam and got a 100 as someone whose home school is SESP (we never have tests). you def have to put effort in, but it should never be too demanding!",
                    "36": "This was a really interesting course.  Professor Nusslock is great and conveys the information very well.  It can be a little nerve wracking that 85% of the grade is 2 exams, but a nice consequence is the workload is not bad at all.  Be warned though, the second exam is definitely harder than the first.  Either way, I really recommend this course, especially to those without a background in neuroscience.",
                    "37": "Pretty good for an intro neuroscience course–– super interesting if you are interested in depression, anxiety, and substance–use.",
                    "38": "PROFESSOR NUSSLOCK IS THE BEST!!! Highly highly recommend taking this class with him. The class is extremely engaging and well organized, probably the most I've ever learned in a single intro class at Northwestern. The lectures are absolutely fascinating. <br>In addition to being top of his field and very published/cited, Professor Nusslock is very friendly, down to earth, entertaining, and cares a lot about his students' success. He also takes extra care to make sure that regardless of your academic background (whether you've taken tons of science/psych or none before), the class is both doable and engaging. The exams and assignments are very reasonable to the course content, and since the slides are so great, it is very easy to study. Take Neuro with Nusslock!!!!",
                    "39": "A lot of the material overlaps with material from the intro to psychology class, so if you have taken that this might not be as interesting.",
                    "40": "pretty easy distro! Nusslock is great, exams straight forward.",
                    "41": "I found this class very interesting and the exams and assignments were fairly easy.",
                    "42": "Prof Nusslock is amazing at what he does. The course material can be very dense, but I always walk out of class feeling like I have learned a lot. Not only is he enthusiastic, he also organizes the class in a manner that helps you succeed in the class. There are review sessions before the exam and the tests are very fair. Exams make up the bulk of your grade and there are 2 non–cummulative exams with both mc questions and short answers. As long as you attend lectures and review your notes, you're going to do fine.",
                    "43": "I learned a lot.  Nusslock made the class awesome! He’s so sweet and passionate about the topics! When studying for the test, it felt like a lot of content. It is a bit challenging, but he makes it fun:) Take this class with him. He is very straight forward. The test cover A LOT, but if you study you can do great. His slides are ver helpful for studying and I love that he is not trying to trick anyone. What we go through is what shows up in the test. He is also very encouraging and you can tell he wants you to do well in his class. You have to put in the effort, but it’s always so interesting. I also love that he answers questions a lot during class because it’s engaging and make everything more interesting! He is so knowledgeable you can tell he is very prepared for this class. I respect him and admire his work.",
                    "44": "LOVE THIS CLASS it is the best and super interesting. Professor is literally so sweet and wants everyone to love and understand neuroscience. His lectures are super engaging and he is very good at explaining everything very clearly, that things I was confused on when previously learned became clear. For exams just need to learn the slides, there are no surprises, exams are super fair, and Nusslock just wants you to learn and enjoy the subject. 3 writing assignments throughout the quarter to help you read neuroscience material outside the course work but don't take much time at all and are basically given as extra credit assignments. Textbook reading is technically required and there will be a couple questions on the exam on textbook material, but defiinitely no necessary to read. No work outside of lectures other than the 3 assignments during the quarter and studying for exams – one midterm and one non–cumulative final.",
                    "45": "This class was a lot better than I anticipated. Robin is an amazing professor, and he made a daunting subject easily understandable. His lectures were super interesting, and the exams are not too hard. They require a lot of memorization, but they're not trying to trick you, which is really nice. Robin clearly wants everyone to succeed, which is relatively easy to do as long as you're willing to put effort into memorizing when it's time for exams.",
                    "46": "One of my favorite courses I've taken at NU! Super fascinating and concepts are made accessible for people with little science background. Exams are very detailed but predictable. If you're a Psych major, definitely recommend taking as a Column B requirement!",
                    "47": "Great course! Take this as a basic science",
                    "48": "Take this class as your science distribution! Professor Nusclock is truly amazing as an instructor, and you can tell how passionate he is. As a non–scientist, things were very approachble",
                    "49": "I loved this class! I say this every quarter about my psych classes but intro to neuroscience was so well taught and definitely my favorite class of the quarter.  Professor Nusslock was great, you could tell he was so passionate about the class and its content. I always looked forward to coming to class and rarely felt bored during class. There were only 3 assignments (2 page papers – double spaced) so there was not much you had to do outside of class. And for exams, there were 2, a midterm and a final (which was just based on the 2nd half of the class but was during finals week) and while the exams had a lot you needed to know. They were not designed to trick you and as long as you knew the slides you were fine. They were very few questions from the textbook, so I would suggest just skimming it, to supplement your studying.",
                    "50": "Difficult for distro",
                    "51": "This class was awesome. I had taken the BME version which was much denser/harder to follow – I would suggest this course for Weinberg students who are interested in learning how brain biology relates to your mind throughout life , or to engineering students who want to be able to take their time and develop a more intuitive understand of the brain/mind links. <br><br>10/10 awesome class, not the easiest but in no way difficult at all – just study a bit  &amp; show up to class and you're fine",
                    "52": "This course helped me a learn a lot about the brain. Professor Nusslock is amazing!",
                    "53": "I absolutely loved this course. Although it is challenging and requires a fair bit of memorization for the exams, it was so worth it. Professor Nusslock is by far one of my favorite professors at Northwestern. He is so passionate about psychology, and this shines through during lectures. He is always available for questions after class and his review sessions for exams are very informative. I would highly recommend this course for psychology majors, and anyone who needs a distro. This is, however, a time–consuming course and I would not enter into it lightly if you have an already heavy courseload.",
                    "54": "Well, this class was a letdown. The sad thing is that it was on the verge of greatness. First off, the lectures are way two dense for twice a week, this should be a MWF class. Coming from engineering, where most of our tests are about applying skills in context, I hated that this class was a lot of memorization. It would be fine if we had better detail on what was critical, but since “everything up until a certain lecture is fair game” it was so hard to prioritize information, especially since there are hundreds of slides! The lack of a practice exam didn’t help things either, another chance to actually actively apply these things missed. I know I can do my own studying like flashcards and blurting, but applying a skill is so much more of a stronger way to learn something. Rote memorization needs to die. I would much rather do stoichiometric chemistry problems then this; we’d be doing math but math in context of science, doing a process that helps us understand a chemical process instead of rereading the same shit over and over until it sticks. I get nothing from memorization, everything I had to learn for the midterm has already left my brain. I hated how it made this fascinating subject boring. Imaging how much more exciting and memorable things would be if we got to do our Golgi stains or neuron drawings a la Ramon y Cajal, or look at a neuron under a microscope, or see action potentials play out with a hands on diorama, or do skits about the characteristics of neurotransmitters…I know that this class is huge, but it should really downsize to have a more personal, hands on approach. Or it can settle in its comfortable mediocrity.",
                    "55": "Prof Nusslock is very passionate about teaching. However, the material was a lot. There is a lot of memorization and not a lot of application. For each midterm, I made over 250 flashcards. However, the exam was multiple choice with a few short answers. It seems intimidating but everything is very similar to the slides. Honestly, its not a bad course to take, but its just a lot.",
                    "56": "Robin is an amazing professor!! He is deeply passionate about neuroscience and makes the course easy to follow for beginners. The course is very content heavy and a lot of memorization. There is a midterm (40%), final (45%) and three small writing assignments (15%). The final is NOT cumulative, but the heavy weighting can be daunting. Overall, this is a very good natural science distro, but only take it if you are comfortable with memorization.",
                    "57": "By far the best course I have taken at Northwestern. I'm a Computer Science major and took this class to fill a distribution requirement, and I'm so glad that I did. Professor Nusslock is truly an outstanding lecturer and makes the course content digestible and interesting.",
                    "58": "Nuzzlocke is wonderful. Absolutely take with him. Readings are not required, other than like maybe 1 multi choice question each test. Test is multi choice + short answer, final is much harder than midterm. First half covers general function of neurons, second half gets into the brain more specific contexts like memory and emotion. A LOT of memorization, so be ready for that. Imo, second half is much more memorization for the sake of memorization, and not as interesting as first half, so be ready to force yourself to study for the final lol. Other than 2 exams, there’s 3 papers th at are double spaced 2 pages about a video, article, and paper respectively of your choice, and basically everyone spends 1–3 hrs doing and then gets full credit on.",
                    "59": "This class consists of a midterm (40%), final (45%), and three short writing assignments (each worth 5%). As long as you study the slides and at least glance at the reading, you should be fine. It really helped me to make practice questions (both multiple choice and written) because most of my own practice questions showed up on the test. Professor Nusslock does not surprise you with what will be on the tests. As a non–STEM major, the material was very manageable. I also took AP Psych which helps a ton with this class, especially the first half with action potentials and neurochemistry. The lectures can sometimes be long, especially if the topic is not of interest to you. If you need a science distro, take this class, but if you are interested in psychology, I wouldn't recommend it because it leans more towards the science side of psychology.",
                    "60": "Tons of content but very interesting topics and Professor Nusslock is an awesome lecturer",
                    "61": "I took this class as a distro and thought it was decent. The course was very well structured and organized and the slide the professor uses to teach are comprehensive and explain the material sufficiently. The exams are extremely fair and you only really need to study the slides to do well. I will say that the concepts are pretty dense and for someone who didn't have any experience with neuroscience beforehand, the material was more bio heavy than I expected (I expected it to be more psych based). Regardless, the class was pretty interesting and I would recommend this it as a distro. Keep in mind that you do have to put the work in and study to do well, but an A is definitely attainable.",
                    "62": "This class was interesting and pretty chill! Not a ton of work load, covers a wide breadth of materials, and not incredibly challenging. The final was a bit harder than I had anticipated just because I found the midterm to have been super easy, so I do wish I studied a bit more for the final.",
                    "63": "It does have a lot of readings, but most are covered in lecture. And for exams there's a lot of memorization especially includes biology and chemistry knowledge, so not an extremely easy class.",
                    "64": "This course is very interesting. A lot of material is covered but exams are straightforwards as long as you study the slides, you are in a good place for exams. I highly recommend the course, teh professor makes it very interesting!",
                    "65": "Clear, enthusaistic",
                    "66": "Professor Nusslock is an amazing. I highly recommend taking a class with him if you get the chance. This course included three easy short papers and two exams. The class is a lot of content, but if you memorize the lecture slides for the exam you should be fine. The exams are very straightforward and Prof Nusslock is not trying to trick you at all. The textbooks readings are not necessary at all, but can be helpful if you don't get a particular topic. Overall, I recommend this class if you're interest at all in neuroscience and the brain.",
                    "67": "The lectures are very interesting and informative and the professor is great. I did struggle a lot with the exams, I wouldn’t recommend this class to bad test takers, otherwise the class is great!",
                    "68": "This class is actually great!! I learned so much and it was all really cool applicable info– sometimes the material gets dense but really knowing the slides is all you need– they're great. Not much work outside of class and all and the exams are super fair!",
                    "69": "Professor Nusslock is exceptional. His eagerness for the class is clear and the class time is incredibly valuable in the learning. It is genuinely one of my favorite classes I have taken here, I would recommend you take this regardless of your major.",
                    "70": "This class was really challenging for me. I ended up not doing so well and not passing the class. Take your time to study well &amp; maybe gather a study group.",
                    "71": "Professor Nusslock is amazing! You learn so much about the brain and I found it super interesting!",
                    "72": "Absolutely the best course I have taken at Northwestern! A must take!!!",
                    "73": "I took this course as a required distro. It was a very challenging class for me. Lectures are long and jam–packed with information– and not recorded. Professor Nusslock designs the exams so that they are all based on information from the slides and the readings. But that means hundreds of slides– sometimes with undefined terms– and hundreds of dense textbook pages. Having a background in neuro would definitely make this class more manageable and make lectures more absorbable. With that being said, I struggled but I worked really hard and should be ending the quarter with an A.  There are three short writing assignments worth 15% total, one exam worth 40%, and one exam worth 45%. No study materials are provided for exams, but there is a review session the night before an exam.",
                    "74": "This course can seem intimidating especially as someone who isn’t in STEM but it’s honestly a really good class. The concepts covered are super interesting and relevant. Professor Robin is a great professor who tries to explain this complex bio concepts in a way that is understandable. The exams are super fair and are based on lecture slides. Only few questions on readings, they are truly just a supplement to enhance your understanding. Definitely recommend this course",
                    "75": "Nusslock is amazing, one of my favorite classes. 3 very easy papers and 2 exams, the papers are basically extra credit and you can write them on basically whatever you are interested in. Exams are super straightforward, but it is important to fully understand concepts.",
                    "76": "I highly recommend this as a column B for the psych/minor. Or a natural sciences distro too (no science background needed to do well, but having prior knowledge can’t hurt either). It is semi–heavy in terms of memorization, but everything is clearly explained. You’ll get an A if you show up to class (it’s not recorded) and study a day or two before the exams. Content was really relevant to my life, and I really enjoyed the lecture about circadian rhythms and my sleep cycle.<br><br>Lectures were very engaging, but the professor tended to answer too many questions. This resulted in us getting behind since day 1, and it was hard to focus with constant interruptions. Reading the textbook was absolutely not necessary for the midterms. But do skim the supplemental articles because those can come up in a few exam questions.<br><br>There were 2 non–cumulative exams, one halfway through the quarter (during class), and the other during finals week. Each exam had ~50 MC and 4–5 FRQs. I thought they were reasonable, fair, and easy to finish in the allotted 80 minutes.<br><br>There was no homework other than three short writing assignments. Everyone gets 100 on those. <br><br>As for grading, the midterms were 40% and 45% of our final grade. The 3 writing assignments were worth 5% each.",
                    "77": "Intro to neuroscience with Nusslock is great. There are some units that are necessarily a little dry, but Nusslock does an incredible job making the course engaging. The topics related to emotions and addiction were really well–presented and interesting.",
                    "78": "I loved this course! It was fun. The exams can be somewhat hard but manageable! I enjoyed this class.",
                    "79": "This is a great course. The professor is so kind and genuinely cares about making science accessible. The only thing is that this is A LOT of memorization (I had around 300 flashcards for each of the exams), but the trade–off is the exams are relatively easy.",
                    "80": "This course is awesome and I'd highly recommend taking it. You learn so much in such a digestible format, and Professor Nusslock is really great at engaging students and keeping your focus. I would highly recommend taking this class. There are three writing assignments (two pages each) and they are 15% of the grade. Each exam is noncumulative and the first is worth 40% and the second is worth 45%. Exams are 50 MC, and 5 short answer questions. If you show up to class, study the lecture slides, and enjoy the content, than an A is achievable as studying becomes less of a chore and actually learning and enjoying learning.",
                    "81": "Valuable class for a psych major looking for a Column B requirement! Though some of the topics can be difficult to understand, this class does make the complexities of neuroscience into a more manageable set of information. No textbook reading necessary – all the material is in the lecture slides. So basically no out–of–class work except for studying right before the exams. The review sessions the night before the exam are super super helpful. Important to attend class, and the lectures are pretty interesting –Prof. Nusslock is pumped up about neuroscience!",
                    "82": "Robin Nusslock is so sweet , and  great teacher! Class was low pressure: 3 easy writing assignments 2 midterms (lots of memorization) but just know the slides and you'll be fine",
                    "83": "One of the best classes I've taken. Robin is AMAZING. Can't say enough nice things about him. It's tough for a 200 level but if you study the slides a LOT for the midterm and final and you'll be okay.",
                    "84": "I appreciated how this course covered both behavioral and biological components of neuroscience. The tests were relatively straightforward following the slides from class, but I would also recommend reading the textbook since some of the exam material is either purely from the book or couples understanding from lecture + the book. Content–wise, this course covered many interesting topics––however, the pace could feel a bit quick at times. I also liked the Writing and Media assignments since they gave me the chance to find articles + media pieces that interested me and related to topics in behavioral neuroscience. Robin is also a funny/silly + learned lecturer, giving effective analogies for specific course concepts.",
                    "85": "Not as easy as people make it sound. The topics are actually quite hard and there are so many random details and words you need to know. Also lectures were very boring.",
                    "86": "This is a great course. You'll learn about, memory, consciousness, sleep, drugs, and much more, and its not too in–depth so the tests are not daunting. If you study the slides and make a quizlet you'll do great on the exams. The writing assignments are basically extra credit so just get them done and you should get a 5/5.",
                    "87": "I thought the final was way harder than the midterm. I wish the grade was made up of more than two exams. It put a lot of pressure on each exam.",
                    "88": "Honestly did not go to a lecture after the first 2 weeks b/c tests are super vocab–based; pretty good class and Nusslock is super passionate about getting people interested in neuroscience so would highly recommend if you need a found disp/distro for natural sciences",
                    "89": "I didnt love this class, but that's because im not huge on biology and all the super specific terminology. the lectures were good, but sometimes boring. professor nusslock is super smart and cares about the content and our understanding of it, but sometimes it seemed like he wasn't able to understand that we were beginners. I wish there was homework because the content is dense and hard to process, and I feel like more homework would've help break it down. there were only 3 assignments and you just wrote about something you either read or watched regarding neuroscience. these assignments were fun, but not helpful in terms of understanding the material. the readings are long, but interesting. there's only 2 tests which in theory is nice but I think 3 would've been better bc there's so much content. just study the slides very well and you should do fine.",
                    "90": "I honestly LOVED this class. Prof. Nusslock is so amazing, he makes all the lectures so interesting, engaging, and makes complicated concepts accessible to people with no science background. There is virtually no work out of class. 3 super short writings, 2 noncumulative exams. The exams are so fair, if you study the slides you will do well. The other readings are not necessary. Would highly recommend taking this class with Nusslock if you can. This class alone made me interested in neuroscience.",
                    "91": "You MUST take this class with professor nusslock if you get the chance. Not only is the material extremely interesting on its own, but professor nusslock has to be the best Professor I’ve ever had at Northwestern.",
                    "92": "Really liked this course! The slides are daunting but if you put in the work to study you will do really well. Nusslock is the goat so it makes it manageable. Take it if your on the fence!",
                    "93": "Absolutely take this class! Whether it be for a distro or for the column B psychology requirement, this is the perfect class to take. Nusslock is an incredible lecturer and person who has the ability to make the content actually engaging. The class is so much more than just learning about individual parts of the brain–– while of course there is that too. Nusslock connects each neuroscience part with a psychological concept. He explains everything thoroughly as well, so it is not necessary to have a strong background in science–– this class is actual made for non–STEM students! You can tell that he is very passionate about what he teaches, and it really draws you in. The class is comprised of two exams (worth 40% and 45% of your grade) and three two–page writing assignments (5% each), though Nusslock has admitted that as long as you complete the assignment, it is essentially a free 100% for 15% of your grade.  The exams are very straight forward as well, deriving primarily from the slides. There are readings, though it is not necessary to do them to do well in the class. If ever given the chance, I cannot repeat enough, definitely take this class!",
                    "94": "This is a very straight forward interesting class! The professor is really passionate and funny! I would highly recommend taking this course.",
                    "95": "Really interesting class, Professor Nusslock is great. It is really memorization–based (but I guess that's how a lot of these intro biology/chemistry classes tend to be). It was fairly straightforward to study for though, and the review sessions that Professor Nusslock hosted were very helpful. The exams were also a REALLY big percent of your grade which I was not a fan of but they were manageable.",
                    "96": "This was a great intro to neuro I took for my CSD neuro requirement. Pf. Nusslock is an amazing lecturer and made class really enjoyable. I appreciated how often he took questions and how he was invested in our learning about the brain. I never did any work outside of studying for the exams and assignments and I did totally fine. Definitely an easy course to pass but very interesting!",
                    "97": "This class was super interesting. The lectures were definitely classic lecture style, but there were opportunities for questions. The few writing assignments we had were informative and allowed us to explore our interests through a neuropsych lens. The amount of people who showed up to this class is a testament to the teaching style.",
                    "98": "This class is almost purely memorization so if you can do that you'll be fine",
                    "99": "This was a pretty solid psychology course, a great column B requirement. The course setup was a little tricky because there are only two exams and 3 short papers, so each assignment holds a lot of weight. Also, previous ctecs from the past said to just study the slides and you will be fine, but a lot of the lectures have over 50 slides and he includes some textbook questions on exams that he doesn't mention in class. I would only take this course if you're willing to put effort in both going to class and staying on top of textbook readings, but it is a pretty easy B+/A– for sure.",
                    "100": "Robin is the best instructor  and I think everyone deserves to take this class",
                    "101": "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is remotely interested, as Professor Nusslock is a great professor. He is very passionate about the subject, and is enthusiastic to teaching it to as many students as possible (he allowed more people in than the enrollment cap because of this). During class, Professor Nusslock is good at explaining complex ideas in a way that makes sense to those who have no previous exposure to the field and his slides are very well–made too. He also fields a lot of questions during class, and works hard to learn students' names in the process which is impressive given the class's large size. Definitely go to lecture to hear him speak, and just make sure you know the slides (the readings and textbook mainly reinforce what was covered in lecture and you don't need to read either in great depth).",
                    "102": "This course is a easy course to take for a science credit. There is practically no homework at all (3 papers 2 pages each paper that took less than 2 hours each time) the only challenging part is studying for the tests. The tests are directly off the slides so if memorize the slides should get an easy A, just a lot of information",
                    "103": "This class felt kind of strange. While it's true that most of the content of the class is contained on the slides, we go over such a vast quantity of concepts and topics that it can be overwhelming to understand, especially given that there are no practice questions available. This led to me going into each exam completely unsure of how ready I was. That said,  the concepts were interesting and Nuslock is nice. Not the worst class, but I definitely won't be taking any similar classes anytime soon.",
                    "104": "This was a great course. Would highly recommend as a science distro or just as a course to take in general. It was super interesting and was also not that demanding. You definitely have to study for the midterm and final exams, but as long as you know the slides, you will do well. Prof. Nusslock makes both the midterm and the final very fair exams. There are usually 2–3 multiple choice questions out of around 50 that reference the textbook. So, if you are fine giving up those questions or making an educated guess, you don't have to read the textbook. There are also 3 two–page writing assignments that you have to do, but they are easy and boost your grade. Overall, would really recommend this class. Prof. Nusslock is an incredible professor – really smart, great at communicating ideas, and always makes himself available to answer students' questions."

I definitely struggled with the workload given in this course during the first two weeks of the quarter. However, once you get the hang of it, you'll get used to the flow. Prof Molden is a great lecturer and quite humorous and engaging.",
                    "1": "I really loved this class! It was cool to learn about so many different studies on topics relevant to our own lives. If you prefer take–home writing/papers over timed tests, this is definitely a good choice.",
                    "2": "This course was super engaging and interesting, definitely one of the classes I have learned the most from at Northwestern. There was quite a lot of homework, 2 discussion posts, and 2 responses due weekly, and depending on what week either 1 or 2 short essays due weekly. The discussion posts were quite simple and graded on completion, however, the short essay questions were more complicated and the grading for those were harsh. I would suggest going to office hours and reviewing the short essay before submitting to get the best grade possible.",

However it does take a lot of time outside class to complete the modules, packback questions, and short answer questions. Every week you have a lot of work out of class so only take this class if you are really interested in the topics. Getting good grades in the SAQs is not hard. Although some of them are tricky you can always reach out to TA's.",

                    "5": "The class is not too bad, but I'm not sure if you cover really anything \"brand new\" to an intro to psych class. It is pretty writing intensive, with about 2 2–page papers due each week and discussions due on Packback quite frequently. The lecture videos are all posted, but attendance is taken using iClicker each class session. <br>The only complaint about the class I have is the pre–recorded lecture videos we were asked to watch before classes seemed kind of repetitive to what was talked about in class. That and the TAs seemed to determine grades by throwing at a dart board, their feedback was not the best, so it was hard to learn how to improve your writing. I talked about this with several other students throughout the course who had a similar experience.",
                    "6": "This class is good if you are more of a take–home essay type of person –– however, it does require a lot of time because even though we don't have traditional midterms or finals,  the short answer essays each week are relatively time–consuming as there can be up to two a week.",
                    "7": "This class was pretty difficult to get used to at first since it is a different style of class, but once you know how to handle it, it isn't too bad. The assignments take a bit of work, but if you take good notes then it is easier. My biggest piece of advice is don't push everything off until the last minute since there is a lot of stuff do on Sundays and Mondays.",
                    "8": "I really enjoyed this course because it taught me so much more about social psychology beyond what I had learned in high school. The class was really interactive, and the lecture videos were really helpful in preparing me for class.",
                    "9": "I was able to gain insight into the human behaviors and social psychology.",
                    "10": "I learned a lot in this class and Professor Molden was an engaging lecturer. Because we did not have tests, the weekly homework did end up feeling like a lot also because the modules were always due back to back. Otherwise, the course was interesting and not too hard. The material and content was well selected.",
                    "11": "Daily assignments made this class a lot more work than I expected. There were video lectures that were time consuming and made in class time redundant. We had to pay for a discussion board instead of using canvas which I didn't like.",
                    "12": "I had to do some work outside of class previewing and reviewing to be able to complete the short answer questions because they required a thorough understanding and application of the materials.",
                    "13": "A lot of supplemental work outside of class to focus on in class discussions. Prof was good, although pre–recorded lectures were a bit repetitive. Prof. was very engaging.",
                    "14": "Doesn't have exams, instead has short answer questions and discussion posts. Could take two psych classes at a time without as much pressure.<br>Molden is mid lecturer but content is mostly interesting. <br>Didn't have to do any of the readings in the class and got by fine (I just liked watching the videos).",
                    "15": "Prof. Molden's unique approach to a pretty standard course makes the content more interesting, in my opinion. While it was hard at first to time out the weekly workload, eventually the class got into a rhythm and it was straightforward to keep track of modules and short answer assignments. The short answer assignments hold significantly more weight than other aspects of the class, so I would suggest taking good notes on the modules to make your life writing the short answers easier. Although some of the content Prof. Molden assigns to read doesn't end up being very useful for formulating written answers, he cares about the course and his attention to questions in class shows this.",
                    "16": "I was really excited to take this course as I have interest in the field of social psychology, and I don't think it is a bad class, it just wasn't what all that I expected. I found some of the topics covered I had already learned in AP Psychology. The new content was interesting and useful, but it was sometimes hard to fully enjoy it with the amount of writing we had to do.",
                    "17": "While the short answers were a bit difficult sometimes, they did really force you to learn the concepts and how to apply them to real life situations. I feel like you come out of the class with a good grasp of psychological concepts and how to use them in daily life.",
                    "18": "The class is interesting and easy, but it's pretty time consuming because you have 3 discussion posts due every class and around 2 short essay assignments due every week. However, the grading on the discussion posts are basically participation and the grading on the assignments is chill. Final exam is open note. Good psych elective or distro!",
                    "19": "This is probably the most time–intensive psych class I've taken at NU (I'm a senior who has taken a lot of psych classes). The material is very useful and applicable to real life, but the professor makes it clear at the start of the quarter that you'll have to put in a lot of time. In place of exams, there are 1–2 nearly weekly assignments (max 2 pages each) that ask you to apply the material to a hypothetical situation. You also have to watch recorded lectures and do readings before each class. There is a discussion post and 2 responses based on the readings/videos due the day before each class on a separate website called Packback, and each post or comment you make is graded using AI. That said, if you go to class and put in the work, it's very easy to get an A. There are also 3 opportunities for extra credit which occur in place of the usual class time, so it's definitely nice to have 3 classes off. If you're interested in the topic but have a heavy schedule, I'd suggest taking this class during a different quarter.",
                    "20": "Professor Molden has a style of teaching that i understand doesn't really work for everyone but it 100% worked for me. He posts videos and readings before class and then goes over the concepts in the lecture sections, all the SAQs are based on the modules you cover. It's not like the workload is heavy but it is something that you have to try and be consistent with, the take–home final exam is basically just more SAQs which is nice.",
                    "21": "This is not the level 200 psych class you are looking for. Prof molden, as lovely as he is, does not know how to explain things that should be simple in a clear and coherent way. The flipped classroom format is also incredibly time consuming and repetitive. Is it hard? no. Is it nice that you dont have exams? yes. but it is just annoying at times.",
                    "22": "I did not like this course at all. The lecture is an hour and a half of Professor Molden speaking non–stop about factors, and studies, and everything under the sun every single class period. We have 2 discussion posts and a discussion question on a different website that you have to pay for due every class and 2–two page papers per week as well.  The class also speaks on social psych in very strict right and wrong approaches which is counterproductive to understanding human behavior. Overall I would not recommend the course however there are no exams and it is contract grading, so there are some positive aspects of the class as well. I would look for another class but if you have to take it, it won't be the worst class you ever take.",
                    "23": "I think the online discussions and the written homework assignments were important to helping me learn, and also going over everything during the in person lectures helped.",
                    "24": "Awesome course and Molden is a great guy and Professor. You will learn concepts through research and apply them. However, the workload is no joke – seriously. The pre–lecture materials take hours to work through each (and there are two on Mon &amp; Wed). You will learn a lot and go in depth as a result but it is seriously a lot if you engage as much as you should. However, the content is fascinating and you will actually see what you learn in the world around you and feel like you have some \"superpowers\" after taking it. Professor Molden is clearly an experienced teacher.",
                    "25": "The content of this course is very interesting and you will learn a lot. If you are looking for a distro class that is not as time consuming, this class may not be for you. Although the material is not difficult, there is a lot of busy work with 2 discussion posts and 2 short answer questions due each week. There are no exams which is nice but if you feel like you won't be able to put in the time for busy work then I would not recommend this class. Overall, not too stressful of a class but would not consider it that easy of an A. Lots of extra credit opportunities!",
                    "26": "This course is a lot of work. Every class has a discussion post and two responses due based on readings that take an hour to an hour and a half. These posts are due a day before the class, which leads to you having work due at 11 AM  on Sunday morning. While these are graded for completion, the two two–page assignments are certainly not and they are graded harshly. While this course was pretty interesting and I liked Professor Molden as a lecturer, I would say that this class was not worth it unless you have to take it or you are really interested.",
                    "27": "I love psychology so I thoroughly enjoyed this course. I will say that it can be very time–consuming considering a lot of the learning is done outside the classroom through online modules and Packback discussion boards. That being said, there are no midterm exams so that can relieve some stress during midterm week while trying to juggle so many other classes. The lectures were interesting and related a lot of topics to current events which I found very interesting. In all, I liked the course and I'm glad I took it to broaden my knowledge of psychology.",
                    "28": "The discussion posts and short answer responses we had to do for this class were quite annoying. First of all, we had to pay $40 to use a specific website for our discussion posts when we could've easily used Canvas. We also had to do 2 posts and respond to 4 posts every week. On top of that, we also had to do two 2–page response papers every weekend. It just all seemed like a lot of unnecessary work, but at least we didn't have any exams! The lectures themselves were a little dull; I think they would've worked better as 50–minute lectures rather than 70 minutes. Prof. Molden is sweet and good at explaining more difficult concepts. He also made the class as engaging as possible which I appreciated. But as someone who doesn't particularly like psychology that much, this wasn't exactly my favorite class.",
                    "29": "This class is a LOT of work. Weekly essay assignments due, asynchronous videos to watch, participation in class, questions and answers on the asynchronous videos.  This is not an easy class. While the questions are not that difficult, it is a lot of strenuous work.",
                    "30": "This class was a lot of work. There are no exams but there are multiple weekly assignments which take a while to do.",
                    "31": "There were a lot of writing assignments and readings/lecture videos, but it balances out the fact that there were no exams. Also, the discussion posts made the class feel a lot more interactive. However, there was not a lot of feedback given on how to improve in the short answer questions. The class material was fascinating, and Professor Molden made classes as interactive as possible with iClicker and such.",
                    "32": "The scheduling of the homework assignments is unfortunately pretty annoying. I understand the intention behind the multiple platforms for assignments, but some of them feel like busy work. <br><br>Packback was an online service in which you had to submit a question about the course content by 11am the day before class. Then you had to reply to 2 peers by 6pm later that day. Weird deadlines, but the professor explains it as him wanting to incorporate discussion and lectures. This doesn’t always happen, but when it does, it takes the form of a 20–second mention during class and he adds a little logo to the slideshow.<br><br>The contributions to this platform do not really seem to shape the lectures in any meaningful way. It’s sort of just “Someone mentioned X on packback,” brief response, and then he moves on to the next topic. And yes, people did seemingly do research and respond others, but I think that was less of genuine interest in learning and more so that two responses were required, and the platform really liked if you cited a link.<br><br>As far as the lecture videos go (assigned before each class), I really do not know why these are assigned so much. They often use the exact same slides and exact examples of research as we go over in class, so I don’t know why we needed to hear it twice, but maybe it is useful to reinforce the content. However, while these were somewhat annoying to watch in the moment, they were extremely helpful for the final exam &amp; homework assignments. <br><br>Regarding the homework assignments, for as much as they wanted to encourage open ended thoughtful responses, it very much felt like there was a \"right\" answer to the questions. For most of them, it was somewhat obvious where they wanted you to go with the answer. They would all ask for \"research\" to support your answers, but this research was almost always pulled straight from either the week's lectures or lecture videos, or both. If your answer didn't quote align with the class' explanation or research examples, you lost points. <br><br>The professor does present the information in an interesting way, and I liked the course, but the unrelenting busy work is frustrating at times. There are also frequent engaging activities in class that add depth to the lectures. I appreciated the use of iClicker to both take attendance &amp; facilitate direct contributions from everyone in the class. Overall, the work adds up quickly, but the class is interesting and informative. He knows this though, and, for what it's worth, include a clear disclaimer on Canvas about the workload. <br><br>The final exam was also pretty fair, and did a good job of spanning across the content of the course. All in all, decent course.",
                    "33": "Professor Molden is a great lecturer and makes the course interesting with a very structured schedule &amp; various interactive exercises. He also makes sure to post all of the lecture videos, which help a lot. However, the course load is VERY heavy compared to other 200–level courses. All the assignments are definitely interesting and intellectually stimulating, but they can be a lot because deadlines are so frequent.",
                    "34": "This class was a lot of work!!! Prof Molden warned us about this at the start of class and in the syllabus and it was no joke. I spent more time on this class than I would've liked. You are expected to prepare for each lecture by watching a multiple asynchronous videos and readings then writing two discussion posts and responding to four classmate responses per week. There were also two free response questions (max 2page double–spaced) due per week which were graded somewhat harshly and given no feedback. Some of the content was recognizable from Psych110, but for the most part the material was interesting. Still this course would've been much more enjoyable with a less intense workload."

                    "3": "Take this class!! Wendi is such a good professor– she's super engaging, loves what she teaches, and is always willing and excited to answer any questions. Grades were composed of 2 team projects (short papers that weren't super difficult), weekly canvas mini–quizzes (3–5 questions, good prep for exams), and 2 non–cumulative exams (multiple choice, two short answers, &amp; 1 essay question). I truly cannot say enough how much Prof. Gardner is a joy to have in class– I'm always excited to see what she has in store for us, and she's always excited to share it :)",
                    "4": "TAKE THIS CLASS. Wendi Gardner is the reason I added a psych double major. This class was SUPER engaging and fun. There was a short quiz every other week but it was only 4 questions and open note. She made it really clear when you needed to read the text book and when you didn't. There were also two team papers, but they were not super difficult. She also offered MANY extra credit assignments. There was one midterm and a final, but if you attend lectures and take notes you should be okay. This was my favorite class this quarter. The topics were very interesting and applicable to my life. TAKE THIS CLASS!",
                    "5": "Great class. Prof Gardner is enthusiastic and knowledgable. Fair amount of grades – weekly short quizzes, team papers, extra credit opps, 2 exams. No need to read all textbook chapters, just the ones specified in syllabus. Class content is fun to learn about!",
                    "6": "I don't feel like there is a need to write too much. I am obsessed with Gardner. She is just incredible. If you are gonna to psych, trust me, take this class.",
                    "7": "TAKE THIS COURSE!! Professor Gardner is the most likable, knowledgable, and engaging professor I've had so far, and I'm definitely planning on taking more courses taught by her in the future. She is very familiar with the studies she's referencing, and cares deeply about all her students. She sprinkles in several extra credit opportunities throughout the course, and overall makes the content very interesting. There isn't that much reading required for this class, and I honestly think someone could get an A without reading the textbook at all. At the end of the last lecture, when professor Gardner was telling a personal anecdote to conclude the course, I literally could not stop myself from smiling the whole time. She's that good.",
                    "8": "I really liked this course! Wendi is clearly very passionate about social psychology and it makes the lectures and content interesting. Each lecture has a TON of information, which is difficult for exams (she expects you to pretty much memorize everything on the slides, which is a lot), but all of it is applicable to your own life. Although almost the full 80 minutes were taken up by Wendi talking the whole time, it felt pretty easy to stay engaged. She also clearly wants her students to succeed in her class and gives lots of extra credit opportunities throughout the quarter.",
                    "9": "Professor Gardner was always excited to teach her class. It helped to keep the class engaged and interested in the course material.  The quizzes are not too bad, just be careful with the wording because that one point off cant count for a lot especially if the quizzes are out of 4 –6 points. Still, there are many extra credit opportunities as long as you are present in lecture, you can take advantage of these.",

                    "11": "Wendi Gardner is a lovely human and one of the best professors I've had at Northwestern! Even though some of the material in this class is dense, she makes it fun and her lectures are always engaging. She includes fun photos and videos on her slides that relate to the course content and even tested some of the social psych studies on us during one of the lectures! The tests require a lot of memorization (which I found difficult since some of the topics were quite similar to one another) but despite the challenges from the tests, I really enjoyed this class and always looked forward to lecture.",
                    "12": "I love this class! The information we learned was so cool and really helped me understand myself and the people around me better. I definitely recommend this class to non–psych majors as well for this reason. The homework and exams were very reasonable as well. If you know everything covered in lectures and assigned readings you're good to go.",

This class is so interesting and I wish I hadn’t taken it with Orgo and Bio so I could have paid more attention to. But I ended with an A– putting effort just before exam day, so you will be fine. We learn a lot about romantic relationship, which was the 4 best lectures I had in my life. WG knows how to conduct a lecture and gather your attention.",

The workload for the class is pretty chill and consists of 2 non–cumulative exams (most of the questions are based on her lectures, and she indicates which portions of the textbook you need to read in advance), 2 group projects (which weren't too long), easy weekly open–note quizzes on Canvas, and a few opportunities for extra credit. The content itself is super interesting and very applicable to everyday life. Somehow this class taught me not just about social psychology, but about how to be a better person and friend to those around me. I highly recommend anyone to take this class with her!",
                    "18": "I took this class because I heard really good things. This class did not disappoint. Every lecture was super engaging and interesting. This was the first psych class that I took with only 2 exams so they were definitely more spread out with more time to study. There was a lot of content but you could get away with just studying the slides and the assigned sections. I appreciated the extra credit opportunities throughout the quarter!",
                    "19": "This class is great! The material is interesting, and you get to learn how to be a better person in society, which is a plus. The exams are straightforward and not designed to trick you at all, and Professor Gardner is wonderful. She does go pretty quickly, but she makes time for questions, and it's a lot of material. Nothing felt excessive, and it was all tied together really nicely.",

                    "22": "took 110 w Gardner freshman year and loved it. 213 only cemented her place as one of the best psych profs at nu. Content given in a very straightforward manner, exam not made to trip you up",
                    "23": "This course was very fun, especially with Prof. Gardner. Although most of the grade was from the two exams, she gave plenty of opportunities to improve your grade. The content was very interesting and was taught very well.",
                    "24": "Wendi is the BEST! This is the second class I have taken with her and I cannot rave about her enough. She knows her stuff and is so passionate about the material that you grow to just love the subject too! There were two non–cumulative midterms and weekly open–note short quizzes. The group papers felt like they were a bit on a time crunch, but they were always so doable and challenged us to apply our knowledge. There are a generous amount of extra credit opportunities, and I have honestly never enjoyed a class more.",
                    "25": "super interesting course. dr. gardner is a fantastic lecturer and if you are interested in people/psychology in any way you are going to be fascinated by the things you learn in this class. exams are admittedly hard, but study hard and often and you'll be fine",
                    "26": "TAKE THIS CLASS! It's actually so fun and interesting. Wendi is the best lecturer I've had at Northwestern and her passion is so clear. There is no homework other than a weekly, open–note, take–home reading quiz that's only 3–4 questions. Assessments include two non–cumulative midterm exams and two group essays. The group projects might be a little intimidating if you don't' know anyone in the class, but make a friend or take this with someone you know and you'll be fine. Only having two exams means both cover A LOT, but the slides are so full of information and are put on canvas right after every class. If you study off of the slides well, you'll probably do great.",
                    "27": "Gardner was awesome, the tests were a little hard, as well as the weekly quizzes, but nothing you won't be prepared for. Overall, great class",
                    "28": "Wendi is such a good professor and just the nicest person. She is really good at providing relevant and memorable examples that relate back to course content. The readings are honestly not necessary but be sure to at least skim them and read through the key terms before each exam. And always go to lecture because the examples she uses and way she phrases things in class are often exactly what is on the exam",
                    "29": "This class is amazing. I learned so much. There was a lot of material on the exam, but the material is really interesting so it is enjoyable to learn.",
                    "30": "Prof Gardner is a great lecturer, also very responsive and understanding. Grade consists of two exams, two group papers, and several extra credit opportunities. You will do pretty well if you just pay attention during lectures and skim the recommended textbook chapters.",
                    "31": "this class was super interesting and i really learned a lot, however it is actually challenging and easier than you think to get a b+ or a– instead of an a, the questions on the tests can be kind of tricky. But Prof Gardner is super knowledgeable and a really interesting lecturer and I would definitely recommend this class",
                    "32": "I found this course to have pretty engaging material. There's quite a bit of it packed into the two exams, but it overall felt manageable given the short weekly quizzes on Canvas and the time you have to prepare. The two team papers aren't much of a hassle either. Would recommend to those with any interest in psychology or sociology.",
                    "33": "I loved this course!! Professor Gardner is amazing at lecturing I quite literally don't know how she does it and doesn't stumble even once while lecturing. I thought that the course content was really interesting, and that it was easy to recall content from class on the exams due to the questions resembling mostly everything taught in lecture. The class also doesn't really have a ton of work, just weekly short (3–5 question) quizzes, the midterm/final, and two group papers (each person contributes like a page of writing). Professor Gardner also provides a ton of extra credit opportunities which I think is really nice and generous. Overall, really recommend taking this class with Professor Gardner!!",
                    "34": "The text is kind of useless, but overall this class is great. Study the slides hard for the exams and you'll be fine. Professor Gardner is a phenomenal teacher and the content is super interesting.",

                    "36": "Professor Gardner was truly the highlight of this course. Her lectures were very engaging and her passion for the subject really came through. I highly recommend this class if you have any interest in social psychology. The workload was very manageable. We had weekly miniquizzes on Canvas due every Sunday, two team papers, and two exams throughout the quarter. Professor Gardner also offered several extra credit opportunities. The exams are difficult but it helps to begin studying several days in advance.",
                    "37": "It was really easy to follow the course material. Professor Gardner did a really good job during lecture in breaking down topics and providing research examples as explanations for research findings. The team essays and exams were also graded fairly. Overall, it's a good introductory course into social psych!",
                    "38": "Wendi is amazing. Amazing lecturer, great course.",
                    "39": "This is an absolutely amazing class, and Wendi is an amazing professor – super nice, helpful, knowledgeable, you can ask her questions and just end up chatting forever. Every lecture is super interesting, ranging from topics like belonging to attitudes to prejudice to groupthink. Really interesting, while not being a heavy workload – only need to look at slides and read specific sections of chapters that Wendi tells you before exams (ends up being like 15 pages reading total for each exam). Group papers are rough if you don’t have a good group, but interesting enough to actually enjoy either way. Take this class if you are interested whatsoever in the topic, or need a chill but interesting class.",
                    "40": "Good class.  Gardner teaches about interesting concepts but sometimes her lectures can be boring.  Most of the time they are fun and interesting though.  At times, it feels like a vocab class where psychologists just assigned new words to concepts that are entirely common sense.  Pretty easy class though.  Just go through the slides and readings before the exam and you will do 90+ on the exams.  Two team papers that are really not much work at all.  Good distro class with interesting concepts taught.  Would recommend.",
                    "41": "Professor Gardner is one of the best professors I’ve ever had. Her friendliness and enthusiasm about the material made me genuinely excited to come to class every day. The course material is highly applicable to everyday life and very interesting – I would recommend this course to everybody, even if they are not a psych major.",
                    "42": "While I liked the content of the course I did not love how the assignments were set out. The group projects had a very short turnaround and were such a small portion of the grade it did not seem worthwhile. The first exam was also unnecessarily difficult and the TAs were not even able to explain the multiple–choice answers. That being said, Professor Gardner is a great lecturer.",
                    "43": "Professor Gardner is amazing. Take this class with her. She has several extra credit assignments. The team papers aren't the greatest, but they're not  that bad. The two exams are fine and there's no final. Take this class with her!",
                    "44": "I LOVED THIS CLASS!! Def take it with Wendi. I was interested and engaged in all the concepts we discussed and Wendi is a genius when it comes to Social Psych. You can hear the excitement in her voice every class. The only bad thing is that the 2 midterms are worth like 80% of the final grade and there is A LOT of memorization involved. We had weekly quizzes and 2 team projects but that's all!",
                    "45": "I loved this class! It was super interesting and applied very well to real life. Professor Gardner is an amazing lecturer and you can tell she cares a lot about her students.",
                    "46": "Overall a good psychology class. Professor Gardner is clearly very knowledgeable about the subject and gives lots of information on every topic. It does not require a lot of outside of class work except for the two team papers, which take a bit of time. Otherwise very manageable and fairly interesting.",
                    "47": "Wendi is an amazing professor who clearly cares about what she is teaching! The course is not very time consuming but is super interesting and you learn a lot about phenomena that seem unimportant! TAKE THIS CLASS!",
                    "48": "I really enjoyed this course! Professor Gardner teaches in an effective and engaging manner, and it was easy to follow. I also appreciated the structure of the course. It wasn't too demanding, allowing me to genuinely learn the interesting content.",
                    "49": "Overall good class, Professor Gardner is knowledgeable and nice. She answers any questions you have and replies to emails promptly. Her lectures are interesting and not boring.",
                    "50": "Very interesting course but heavy weight on the exams so study hard for them",
                    "51": "I highly appreciated that Prof. Gardner's slides were informational and easy to study with for exams and quizzes. She chose to expand on topics that she knew would be very appealing and compelling for us students, and also included many studies that helped enhance our understanding of topics.",
                    "52": "I LOVED this class!! It was so interesting and I learned a ton. For the most part, the workload is light with weekly quizzes. Group projects can be time consuming but enjoyable if you have a good group (I recommend taking the class with friends!). Exams are tough. I studied a lot for the exams (studying a full week in advance of the exam), yet I still did not do great on the multiple choice sections. However, the content is so interesting that I would still recommend taking it. Exam difficulty is definitely something to be mindful of, though."

The exams are 50–65 multiple choice questions, and they are not too difficult, but it is very important to attend lectures and study the slides. Not an easy A but a great class overall.",
                    "1": "I would recommend taking this course with Professor Bodenhausen, he is a very good lecturer and his slides are well put–together. Taking notes (~40 pages of reading per class) outside of class and one written assignment were the only homework. Tests were very fair.",
                    "2": "This is a pretty good 200–level psych class if you're a psych major. The content is really interesting and the exams are very fair as long as you study the lectures and do the readings.",
                    "3": "I loved the lectures for this class. The content was always interesting, and the specific studies we looked at could be very entertaining. I didn't feel like I needed to study too much to feel good in the exams. By reading the key concepts at the end of sections in the textbook and highlighting/being familiar with notes, I was confident.",
                    "4": "Solid distro for the School of Comms social sciences/ethics credit. My advice is to NOT read the textbook readings, as they actually make things more confusing. (I got much better grades on the second and third tests, after only reading the chapter summaries of the textbook instead of the whole chapters.) Only read the summary!<br><br>Course info was slightly less interesting than expected, but enough to engage me as a non–STEM major looking to fulfill a credit. Class is an easy A–/A if you pay attention in lecture and organize your study guides well ahead of time.",
                    "5": "This class wasn't a hard class but the exams were harder than the topics made it seem like as the questions were made to be tricky and readings also carried some importance in the exams.",
                    "6": "TAKE THIS CLASS! This class made me realize I wanted to double in psych. Because it's social psych, it covers concepts we're exposed to all our lives and provides new insight onso many common misconceptions we have about ourselves and the social world! It was so interesting. The exams are not too difficult (noncumulative multiple choice) , as long as you review your notes and just read the summary bullet points of each textbook chapter. Professor Bodenhausen strays from the slides a lot so make sure to pay attention in class.",
                    "7": "I learned so much but it was not an easy A like other people say...",
                    "8": "I enjoyed this course! The content was fun and easy to digest. Professor Bodenhausen is nice, but his lectures are pretty boring. The slides are pretty good and if you go to class you don't really have to do the readings. However, if you don't go to class the readings give you everything you need to know. There's 3 exams all multiple choice that are pretty easy (the final is harder than the midterms though). There's only one homework assignment that's easy and the rest of the points come from writing exercises in class (essentially attendance points). Overall its a good course to take, lectures are just boring.",
                    "9": "very interesting course learned a lot and not that difficult",
                    "10": "I overall enjoyed this class. I took the class because of a prereq for IMC and I think that the material learned in class can be applicable amongst many different subjects. I like how versatile the class is in this sense.",
                    "11": "I LOVED THIS CLASS! I think it is insanely interesting and applies to so many areas of life outside of a learning setting. Professor Bodenhausen is a straightforward lecturer, which at times can be boring, but if you're interested then you will be engaged. 3 tests and no final, all of which were pretty fair and straightforward. Some questions on tests were from readings so read the textbook or at least skim. No homework, as long as you take good notes in class you'll be perfectly prepared for tests. A lot of good research examples to help you understand topics.",
                    "12": "This class was great. The prof. is a great lecturer and is very organized. I learned a lot about social psychology, and the exams were very fair.",
                    "13": "This class is a lot of long lectures and readings. The professor speaks a little in a monotone voice so it is easy to zone out but as long as you make flashcards and study you will be just fine. No practice problems for the exams but they are all multiple choice.",
                    "14": "This course is really easy if you do the readings and take notes in class (and study). It's really only exams, so if you're reviewing the information as least two days before each exam, you should be fine. And the exams are not cumulative, so that helps too. <br><br>Attendance is sort of important as there's a writing exercise at the end of class that has to be turned in physically that contributes to a small–ish percent of your grade; but the exercises are not hard.",
                    "15": "I definitely recommend this class. The readings are super easy to get through and Prof. Bodenhausen is very organized and efficient. The lectures can be dull, but the slides give you all the information you need. Exams are just multiple choice, derived from the content you're given. Not an especially challenging or mind–blowing class, but still interesting, and definitely good if you need a lighter course on your schedule.",
                    "16": "Very informative but low stress.",
                    "17": "This was a pretty solid intro psychology class. Bodenhausen is a pretty good lecturer and his slides are very organized and comprehensive. Sometimes lecture feels a little long because he's a little monotone but honestly, the content is really interesting and he is a very organized professor. Attendance is technically taken, as you have to do a writing exercise at the end of each lecture for a point. Exams are pretty fair and straightforward, it's all MCQ and all you really have to do is study lecture notes and do the readings. There's no homework, and the only time you really have to do any work for this class is studying for the three exams. It's pretty low–stress and if you take good lecture notes, you'll be fine. I recommend it if you're looking for an interesting and chill psychology class.",
                    "18": "Tests mostly focused on lectures but there are textbook readings that go with it. I recommend skimming the textbook. Curves to the highest test score. Every class had a writing assignment but it was mostly if you wrote something down. So just show up to class.",
                    "19": "Go to lectures, take good notes, and study for the exam. Multiple choice and straight forward tests. Overall easy, prof is understanding of people with accommodations",
                    "20": "Grade is mostly based on 3 midterms, so study for those. He posts the slides, but I would advise going to class because there's a short writing assignment at the end of each one that gives you an extra point. 80% of the exam is based on content from the slides and the other 20% is based on the textbook. I would recommend this class! It's like zero work outside of class except for studying for midterms.",
                    "21": "He's an amazing lecture that kept me engaged, but his midterms can be tricky.",
                    "22": "The content is very interesting, I would say that all the questions on the exams are related to things said in class, so make sure that you're going to class and paying attention.",
                    "23": "This class was super easy and great if you are looking to fulfill a foundational discipline/distro requirement! Your grade is mostly comprised of your test scores from 3 multiple choice, non–cumulative tests. As long as you study the slides and skim through the readings for key terms/ideas, you should do well on the tests! There are a couple homework assignments throughout the course which take around 15 minutes max to complete. There is also a tiny writing prompt at the end of each class. It is just graded for completion! This class is an easy A and super applicable to everyday life! It is a very low time commitment and I could not recommend it more!!!",
                    "24": "Make your own quizlet that includes textbook terms and you will get an A.",
                    "25": "Not the most effective class to take if you have basic social awareness. Everything feels very intuitive, which can actually help with retaining information for tests. 3 tests throughout the course, all non–cumulative. Show up to get participation points with a very simple exit ticket at the end of class. Lectures can be long and hard to stay awake for, but the professor is very nice and willing to answer any questions.",
                    "26": "Very straightforward and interesting class –– learned a lot of interesting stuff about social psych. The professor is a little monotonous/not very engaging sometimes but the class content is super interesting. Overall would definitely recommend!",
                    "27": "It was a good course, but the instruction was boring at times.",
                    "28": "Course was interesting and exams were okay",
                    "29": "This is a really good distro as long as you show up to the lectures and take notes. The content is SO interesting and it's even fun when you really get past the first few introductory–ish lectures. All of the content is applicable to real life, so it makes it easier to actually understand the concepts and theories for the 3 exams (non–cumulative). Plus, one of the Tasks was super chill and actually had fun talking to students in office hours. Overall, would definitely recommend especially if you don't want to do math in a psych course.",
                    "30": "This class was super chill. The professor is a really good lecturer, and the content is super interesting, so it's not that hard to stay engaged the whole class. However, the class is not recorded, so it's heavily recommended that you go. The slides are really concise and sometimes can be confusing to understand / piece together if you weren't present for class. The exams were easy, around 50–65 multiple choice questions. If you go to class and take good notes, you'll do fine. He doesn't deviate much from what he says in lecture. The was also a single homework assignment that was meant to give students more points, and you also have a writing exercise each class to account for attendance. The textbook readings are supposed to be required, but most people don't do them. I would say there were about 5 questions from the textbook readings each exam, or there would be vocab from the textbook as answer choices for a multiple question, which could get a little confusing at times if you didn't know what the vocab word meant because you wouldn't be able to eliminate it. However, the stuff that he tests from the textbook readings are all vocab related, so what I did was just go through each chapter and make quizlets of all the vocab and I reviewed them literally the night before just to understand the vibes / general meaning of each word. But honestly, you can probably still get an A without doing the readings, as long as you're solid on the lecture material. This class was probably my chillest class this quarter because there's no regular homework aside from just studying for exams. If you review content as you go through the course and do some extra studying a few days before the exam, it's a breeze. And the content was super interesting, it's really relevant and applicable to your everyday life.",
                    "31": "I thought this class was pretty interesting overall. However, I felt like the lectures were generally a bit boring, as it was mostly Prof. Bodenhausen just lecturing at you. He also has a sort of calming voice, which definitely didn't help with that. I would recommend doing the readings, they help you know what class will be about and probably help you to be more interested and focused. I didn't do many of the readings because I had lots of readings from other classes too. The exams were all multiple choice, which was nice.",
                    "32": "This class is essentially all about going to lecture and studying for exams. Bodenhausen is a very good lecturer and you learn a lot, but lectures aren't particularly exciting or fun at all. The textbook isn't very important and if you study based on the lecture slides and outlines you will be more than prepared for the exam.  As a psychology course, you learn a ton and get exactly what you expect.",
                    "33": "Although very interesting topics, the lectures often felt a bit dry and not really engaging. The work was not too bad at all but I did have to study for the tests quite a bit, since your grade is heavily based on your performance on the 3 midterms.",
                    "34": "I think it was crucial to read the textbook for the tests, but I also studied pretty hard for these tests and didn't do well. I went to every class, did every assignment, and read every textbook page – I honestly think the questions may have intentionally been tricky....I'm not sure. It was a good class, very interesting, and necessary to take for a psychology major/minor, but I was disappointed in my performance even after I worked hard to do well.",
                    "35": "nope",
                    "36": "I really liked the course. There were only three exams, and there was no final. You don't really have to read the chapters unless you want to, and the material covered in the lectures was basically the content of the exams.",
                    "37": "I found this material super stimulating. Especially learning about attraction and aggression",
                    "38": "Great class. 3 MCQ exams. Go to lectures because the slides aren't enough information to do good on exams.",
                    "39": "This was a great class. Everything is very upfront with Bodenhaussen, and the content is really interesting.",
                    "40": "Great class. Boddenhasuen can be a little deadpan but I personally found him to be engaging and very clear with his descriptions (I am a psych major so maybe take that into account).  Lecturers included good studies and videos to back up what he was saying. Tests are very fair and simple if you learn the terms straight from the lecture and review the slides.",
                    "41": "I really enjoyed the course! It was clear Professor Bodenhausen was very passionate about the subject and wanted to ensure we all learned the material. I personally really liked that there was not much outside material we had to focus on. We really just had the 3 exams we had to study for. And if you reviewed the lecture slides and textbook readings then you would most likely do a good job. Attending lectures were also mandatory because there were in–class assignments you had to complete after each lecture. And also there was 1 homework assignment that was really straightforward. Overall, great class!",
                    "42": "The course was pretty interesting and has lots of cool research that is very up to date. Lectures are quite slow but it is a chill class as you only need to take notes on lectures, the slides are later posted and the exam is about the content. Professor is really understanding and does interesting research but it is a slow class.",
                    "43": "good low level psych class/distro, not too hard and professor is good at communicating information",
                    "44": "There are 3 midterm exams for this class, so make sure you study and do very well on them as that is what your grade is entirely based on. If you're taking a bunch of classes with 3 midterms I wouldn't recommend this class, as I found it very difficult to balance all of the exams. Because you only have these exams to make up your grade you need to do well on them or you won't do well in this class, so just keep that in mind. The professor is amazing and his lectures are super interesting though! I really enjoyed taking this class.",
                    "45": "This class is amazing, I loved the readings and lecture content. The professors can sometimes ramble or sound monotone, but otherwise, the TA's are extremely kind and helpful (and AVAILABLE), and there isnt ever homework. Only readings. Great class, I learned so much.",
                    "46": "I had a very very positive reaction to this class. The content was fascinating and taught in a very clear way. I had heard the professor wasn't engaging, but while his voice is slightly monotone, I thought he taught very well and helped me learn the material very clearly. And it feels like a very manageable amount of work while also teaching me a lot. I loved the content and the professor and would definitely recommend it to anyone who asked.",
                    "47": "My least favorite professor I have ever had at Northwestern. The professor often used class time to voice his opinions on the state of the world– very unusual and odd. The class material itself was fine and relatively interesting, but the professor's monotone unenthusiastic teaching combined with his need to insert his own \"takes\" was not conducive to learning. The exams were very easy, and although attendance is mandatory (daily writing exercises), I never felt I needed to take any notes throughout the quarter. Overall class felt like a large waste of time, and I wish I had taken it with a different professor because the topic could be super interesting. It was just a very unusual experience for a Northwestern course, normally I absolutely adore my classes, especially psych.",
                    "48": "This was a pretty good class. Prof. Bodenhausen's is very knowledgeable. The lectures were a bit monotonous and boring, but all the material was interesting. The class is also very manageable. We had 3 midterms (all non–cumulative), which were very manageable, and that was pretty much it. You don't have to do the readings because the only reading material that would show up on the exams was in the chapter summaries (so just read those before the exams). We did have to do a little writing exercise at the end of class, so you do have to show up to class, but those write–ups were just graded for completion, so not hard to do well on them. Overall a pretty easy class. As long as you study, you will do well on the exams.",
                    "49": "You have to come to class but if you do and take great notes and study before the exam, you can get an A.  There's class participation at the end of every class which can really make difference in your grade. Boring lecture. Really boring"

                    "4": "McAdams is a super intelligent guy, compelling lecturer, and all around super interesting person. Class was so fun to just sit and learn about this super interesting research and branch of personality.",
                    "5": "Professor McAdams is one of the leading experts in the field of personality psychology, and this class displays why. While there sometimes was too much overlap between the textbook and presentations, McAdams is super friendly, and his insight shines through. The three midterms weren't too terrible, although the reading sometimes was a bit much before every class.",
                    "6": "Loved this class, professor was fun and seemed to enjoy teaching the subject. The textbook we used in class was written by him, only issue I had was that he didn't post the slides to canvas.",
                    "7": "This course was so great!! The topics are so interesting and Prof. McAdams is great at teaching it. He is very organized and straightforward, and if you take notes and do the readings, you'll do well on the exams. The homework is just readings for you to do on your own time, to whatever extent you want, so they're very manageable. I highly recommend this class.",
                    "8": "I very enjoyed all the case studies of interesting personalities in this class",
                    "9": "The class follows an easy to understand structure, the professor is charming, and he really encourages questions during class to solidify our understanding.",
                    "10": "The course gave me knowledge that I can directly apply to my life to make smarter and healthier decisions.",
                    "11": "I loved this course. I was very excited to take it solely based on the description of the class and it ended up being my favorite class. Professor McAdams was very engaging and successful in relaying the key concepts of the course. I found all the textbook readings fascinating and enjoyed the lectures just as much.",
                    "12": "It is interesting but plan to spend a lot of time memorizing materials for tests.",
                    "13": "The lectures were really interesting and the stuff we learned was applicable to everyday life.",
                    "14": "I took this course with McAdams, and I think this quarter was the first time he used a slightly different format to teach in comparison to the previous years. He no longer requires weekly papers due, and there are only three exams throughout the entire quarter, including the final. This class has almost no required workload other than study and prepare for each exam. I found the structure of the class to be overall good, but I recognize some are uncomfortable with the lack of restrictions and requirements needed to follow his class. If you're a freshman, I'd recommend getting used to the northwestern class structures first before taking his class. If you're upperclassmen, I highly recommend this course with McAdams, especially if you're planning to overload in the same quarter and have good study habits. His lectures are very engaging and interesting to listen to, and he always wants people to ask questions about the lectures and overall is a friendly and great professor. If you're looking for purely an easy A class, this may not necessarily be it, but if you're genuinely interested in this topic, definitely take this course.",
                    "15": "pretty good class, make sure to go to lectures because the slides/useful info doesn't get posted, professor mcadams was nice",
                    "16": "This was a very lecture and textbook reading heavy course. I did learn a lot, but at times, the readings felt overly long and not particularly pertinent.",
                    "17": "Professor McAdams is one of the best lectures I have ever attended at Northwestern.  He really knows the topic and is so kind and cute :)<br>However, the way he built the class is not effective because it made so much stressful rather than pleasant for studying personality. It is only 3 exams and 80% of the class is memorization. He asks so MUCH details on exams regarding the book (which he is the author) and the million papers he assigns throughout the quarter. I wish there were another way to demonstrate my understanding in the exams besides exams. Another thing is that even the TAs sometimes don't know how the questions on the exam are structured. I remember attending one OH and the TA asked me to share my thoughts on one of the questions because she didn't comprehend the answer. In general, nice course but it's a lot. If you are busy with another class, take personality another quarter. Def not an easy A.",
                    "18": "This class was so interesting! It was challenging at times and the amount of reading was a lot but all of the supplementary readings really complemented the chapters and ideas that McAdams was building on.",
                    "19": "Your grade is based on 3 exams. If you’re not desperate for an A, you don't need to go to class but you still have to read every textbook chapter. There are a lot of studies that are to be read alongside the textbook that you’ll be questioned on during exams",
                    "20": "Really good psych course. Very interesting and stimulating lectures (both in content and format). Pretty easy to understand the material. Read/skim the studies/non–textbook readings for exam prep and use the textbook to supplement the lectures. McAdams is a good professor with a lot of interest and experience in the subfield so definitely use him as a resource.",
                    "21": "Lectures were super engaging, the first unit on basic traits was a little dry, but the last unit on the autobiographical was so fascinating. The tests include a lot of material from the textbook that wasn't necessarily mentioned in class so I would recommend getting the textbook for sure. The tests are pretty stressful since they include two written essays in addition to the multiple choice, but one of the essay prompt are given ahead of time. They requiring a lot of reviewing for, but McAdams assigns you a grade based on the distribution.",
                    "22": "I  found this course really interesting. There is a bit of outside reading that the prof doesn't cover in class but is still on the exams, which is a little annoying, but generally manageable. I recommend this course to those that are at all interested in psych. The prof was engaging and always happy to answer questions.",
                    "23": "I liked this class a lot! It is very simple class: read a chapter before class, lecture on the reading material, and then exams on readings and lectures. You also pick a famous person to analyze through the course on the exams. McAdams is super nice, very friendly in office hours, but there is not a lot of guidance. Also, he is the author of the textbook we use, so it can be repetitive. Overall, good class for Psych major/minor, but not the most incredible interesting fabulous course ever.",
                    "24": "Since personality psychology is something we can easily relate to our daily lives/ conversations, material from this class is easier to get into. This was definitely my fun class for the quarter.",
                    "25": "dan is a good lecturer, but the final grade shouldn't be based only on 3 tests. There should be a paper, or homework. Also it was really annoying when content on tests came from the textbook which we'd have to PAY FOR outside of what we already paid the school.",
                    "26": "It is a very interesting class and the workload is manageable. There's a fair amount of reading but I find it possible to read all of them before the midterms and finals. It's necessary to go to class because the professor won't post powerpoints and there are important points in class that help you better understand concepts and contents of the book. I think Prof. McAdams is very knowledgeable in developmental psychology and much of the readings are his own work. He is also good at engaging students in class and I find the class enjoyable. The exams might be a bit difficult and consist of an essay question about analyzing a famous figure, but it's definitely rewarding as you go over the quarter and truly understand a famous figure's personality through different perspectives.",
                    "27": "I think it was nice to have a person so passionate about the subject teaching the course. It was interesting to learn about a small subfield of Psych.",
                    "28": "I would highly reccomend this course, it is interesting content wise and the teaching is very good",
                    "29": "This course posed psychological theories that were both familiar and new to me, so it served both as good review and learning.",
                    "30": "Professor McAdams is without a doubt the best lecturer I have had in my time at NU. His lectures are super interesting and I felt like I learned a lot about personality psychology. One thing that is not great is that you will definitely need to buy the textbook, since he wrote it. I also wish there were resources provided to study for the test rather than just having to look over notes and read the textbook.",
                    "31": "This class is pretty chill in my opinion. There are readings assigned for most class days, but you are not tested over them. The only grades were from the two midterms and final. This is okay since if you at least try to study and pay attention to the lectures you will be fine.",
                    "32": "I thoroughly enjoyed the psychology course as it exemplified exceptional qualities. The course was remarkably engaging, with thoughtfully structured lectures that maintained my interest throughout. The organization of the material was impeccable, allowing for a clear and systematic progression of concepts. The instructor's availability for office hours was commendable, providing ample opportunities for additional clarification and discussions. What stood out most was the course's applicability to all students, bridging theory with real–world scenarios, making the subject matter not only intellectually stimulating but also highly relevant to our everyday lives. This combination of engaging content, organization, accessibility, and practicality made the psychology course an outstanding and enriching educational experience.",
                    "33": "PLEASE take this class if you have the chance! Prof. McAdams is probably the best psych professor I've had at this school. His lectures are engaging, current, and well–paced. The readings are super interesting and relevant. The exams are TOUGH, but it makes the class feel much more rewarding. I feel like I learned a lot about psych, but the best part was how much of the content was applicable to my daily life, both in interactions with others and in better understanding myself. Not an easy A, but a must take.",
                    "34": "Professor McAdam's is a great lecturer, and his class covers super interesting content. He takes time to answer students' questions during lecture also, which is super nice. Not an easy A, but if you study for the 3 exams you should be able to get a good grade.",
                    "35": "Difficult but highly rewarding class. Professor McAdams just is so eloquent and knowledgeable about the material. Be prepared for lots of reading and writing, but the exams are curved."

There are quizzes every other week and 3 short papers. If you study minimally and listen/take notes in class, you’ll def get an A",
                    "1": "Prof Mesghina is great! Super well organized, knowledgable, etc. She doesn't just explain the theories but the methods that got us to those theories, which gives us a better understanding of pros and cons. I enjoyed her lectures, and the quizzes/papers were super managable.",
                    "2": "This class is very interesting. Definitely worth it. And you get to analyze your own personality",
                    "3": "Prof Mesghina is super engaging, very cool readings, helped me learn of my own personality! Prof Mesghina teaches Personality differently from Prof Chung or Prof McAdams, more modern and new material! I learned a lot of my own personality, did lots of self reflection! we also talk about the MBTI in a way that doesn't completely disparage it which I thought was super cool. There's also group quizzes which helps a lot of ppl's grades. We also had a NPR podcast + facebook comments section of researchers that I thought was REALLY interesting",
                    "4": "Overall a pretty easy class. There's a few papers assigned to be read before each lecture, but overall not a lot of homework. There are essays every other week, but I found them to be relatively simple and quick to write. Lectures are interesting – Professor Mesghina is a very engaging lecturer. No midterms or finals – just a quiz every other week, alternating with the essays. Quizzes are nice because you take it individually, and then afterwards you can take it again with a group. The group portion is 70% of your quiz score and the individual is 30%. I found this very helpful because you're likely to get a higher grade with a group.",
                    "5": "This course is a great course for those looking to fulfill a Social Science foundational discipline. The quizzes are not too hard if you pay attention in lectures and read the required materials and the writing assignments are graded fairly.",
                    "6": "I loved this class! Prof. Mesghina is super engaging and a very entertaining/relatable professor. Assignments are very organized, so you always know when things are due. The quizzes could be a little tricky at times, but she is super fair with her grading scale. I really recommend this class. The workload is not bad at all, and you learn a lot about personality and yourself.",
                    "7": "This course was incredibly interesting. I would say it was definitely one of my favorite psych classes at Northwestern. Professor Mesghina is an incredible professor and she always makes sure to keep her students engage. The course content was always incredibly interesting.",
                    "8": "GREAT CLASS!! Not at all stressful and you learn a ton about different approaches to personality. Professor Mesghina is super helpful and makes material easy to understand. I always looked forward to this class",
                    "9": "This class was interesting, and a pretty easy class to take for either a psych major req or as a distro, or if you just want to learn about the psychology behind personality. Professor Mesghina made what could have been a pretty boring or standard class very interesting, and the bi–weekly quizzes and character assessment assignments were not bad either.",
                    "10": "Good class, not too much homework that its daunting and very interesting. Would recommend as a fun class or if you are just interested in the topic.",
                    "11": "This course is really interesting if you want to know more about how to assess personalities including your own. We cover so much of personality psychology. Professor Mesghina is awesome. She's fun and knows so much about the subject. We had in person learning assignments to mark attendance, quizzes, and character assessments.",
                    "12": "Very nice, just show up to the lectures and pay attention to understand the concepts. One quiz is dropped, and there is a group section to it which makes it much less stressful. It's quite fun to learn about yourself (if you let yourself have the time to really think through the concepts). The character assessments are very chill as long as you follow the rubric to a T and add a lot of nuance to your descriptions about yourself.",
                    "13": "Quizzes and Writing assignments make up the bulk of your grade. Writing assignments are due every other week and actually can take up a bit of time so set aside time to complete that. Quizzes are all on canvas, every other week. 70% of your grade is the individual portion and 30% is the group portion where you retake the exam with groupmates.  There are attendance points but if you come to class and pay attention to the slides you'll do great. Quizzes can be a little tough, but the group portion should help boost your grade.",
                    "14": "Kind of unnecessarily hard for a 200 level class, wouldn't recommend if you're looking for an easy A for the psych major requirement or unless you're actually really interested in personality psych",
                    "15": "This was one of the best courses I've ever taken at Northwestern so far! Professor Mesghina is such a caring professor, and she made the class really interesting. She is very passionate about the content of this course, and I always enjoyed talking to her after class. This course was also pretty relatable to my own personal experiences since it focused on personality, so I would definitely recommend taking this class with her!",
                    "16": "She was super enthusiatics. Slides were somewhat confusing/ slightly hard to follow. Every week either a quiz (70% of the grade was a collaborative score 30% individual score), or a paper (ab 2–4 pages). In class participation checks but allowed to miss 2, and didn't keep track before the drop deadline. Learned a lot about personality. Felt like my studying efforts were rewarded.",
                    "17": "Pretty easy class and most of the things you learn are from previous psych classes or kind of just common sense, but overall quite enjoyable. I liked the focus on self–exploration, and gained a lot from the self–analysis essays. Prof Mesghina is probably the most Gen Z professor I've ever had and keeps the class lively. Didn't get a ton out of this, but also didn't have to put a ton in, so it works out.",
                    "18": "Overall the class is super fun and interesting with a minimal amount of work. There is essays and quizzes but neither ae too difficult. Prof. Mesghina was so fun and made the lectures very interesting. Would recommend the class for anyone with any interest in personality psychology or just want to take a psychology class for fun.",
                    "19": "This is a great course. Professor Mesghina is so sweet and great at teaching. I learned a lot but the workload is not too bad.",
                    "20": "the professor is so good at making whatever she's teaching clear! the course was also very chill; honestly, I didn't do the readings because she summarized the concepts well enough that I could still do well on papers + quizzes without reading. heavily recommend!",
                    "21": "Good class in the sense that it was not overly demanding and because Professor Mesghina is an enthusiastic lecturer who can connect with her students. Quizzes, however, were poorly written, evidenced by the fact that averages were typically in the 60–70% range despite the concepts being objectively not nearly that complex.",
                    "22": "As a senior not majoring or minoring in Psych who took this class for fun, Dr. Mesghina is the best professor I've had the chance to work with, and I feel so lucky I took this class.  This class is absolutely amazing!  Dr. Mesghina is a fantastic lecturer, she structures the course so well so that you have the chance to explore different aspects of personality psych in good depth, and the work feels enough that you get regular practice but not overwhelming that it becomes too hard.  The topics we talked about were really interesting and connected with a lot of other aspects of psych and humanities disciplines, so if you're interested in interdisciplinary study, I think you'd like the content we talked about in the class a ton.  Most of all, though, Dr. Mesghina is deeply kind and supportive.  She really cares about everybody as students and considering how large this course was, I was really amazed at how much she dedicated to supporting everybody.  It is truly admirable, and I thank Dr. Mesghina a ton for being proactive and rooting for everyone's success.<br><br>Highly recommended, and I cannot recommend this class enough!",
                    "23": "This course was extremely interesting. All topics are learned through applying them to your own life, making the course super interactive and engaging the entire time. Also, Professor Mesghina is a great lecturer, and does a great job considering ideas and thoughts from students.",
                    "24": "I absolutely loved this course!! I personally  took it as a theme requirement for McCormick, and found it to be such an amazing class. The textbook used is genuinely very succinct, so the weekly readings are definitely not time consuming and do a great job of generally summing up key content. Additionally, the research papers assigned are good to read before lecture, but professor Mesghina does a really nice job of summing up main findings during lecture too. I also truly loved Professor Mesghina's instruction so much – she does an amazing job of being relatable, making class engaging (she's so funny and I loved her tiktok references), and treating class as a conversation with students rather than just lecturing during class. The grading for the class is also incredibly fair – 1/3 from class exercises (i.e. just showing up to class), 1/3 from in class quizzes (which are mostly based off of group mcq quiz scores), and character assessments (3 essays analyzing your own personality, super fairly graded and I'm not a strong writer at all). Overall, one of my favorite courses and highly recommend taking this course with Professor Mesghina if possible!!",
                    "25": "It was really interesting material and helped me learned more about personalities in general. The course was composed of 4 quizzes every 2 weeks(every Monday) and 3 papers on personality. Honestly, really light material. The quizzes were definitely challenging.I would study for them yet still somehow do badly on them(super weird).However, I know this was the case for a good percentage of the class. Professor Mesghina would curve them if they were lower than 50% for the correct answer choice.",
                    "26": "good course",
                    "27": "I'm always so excited to take a class with Professor Mesghina, and this course lived up to my expectations. It is a lower–level class meaning that there was less work compared to an upper–level class. We had 3 assessments where we wrote an essay discussing our personality in connection to what we discussed for that portion of the class and 4 quizzes for the class. Overall, Professor Mesghina is focused on the gaps/room for improvement within the field of Psychology, and so, the class was tailored to cover these topics through a lens of cultural psychology. It was interesting, made me think, and helped me understand the various areas and the history of Personality Psychology!",
                    "28": "Professor Mesghina is amazing! She has glowing CTECs for a reason– her lectures are enjoyable and intriguing, and she is very willing to engage with students personally and go back–and–forth with ideas that she clearly takes genuine interest in. She is very relatable for our age group and knows how to make the material easier to understand and work with. The workload is very manageable, with 3 papers (Although they are a little longer, mine tended to be 5–7 pages but that's not a requirement!) and quizzes. The quizzes could be very difficult unless you knew the material very very well, but there is a chance for collaboration to improve which was very helpful! Recommend.",
                    "29": "The quizzes are definitely not easy, so make sure to do the readings. The character assessments were fun because you got to apply the theories to your own life and personality.",
                    "30": "I disliked this class in terms of content. I felt like it was pretty boring and just repeated a lot of theories from other classes. Also, a lot of the material (in my opinions) wasn't really related to personality. Just not super cohesive. That being said, it's kind of an easy A. You get attendance points, 4 quizzes (drop your lowest) and 3 really easily graded personality analysis papers. Wouldn't recommend if you're trying to take this class because you're genuinely interested in personality.",
                    "31": "I'm in McCormick, I haven't done a single reading, and I have a 94% in the class. This should tell you all you need to know about this class.",
                    "32": "Prof. Mesghina is super funny and relatable. She's also really good at explaining difficult concepts, so if you're ever confused, her office hours are a great resource (and she's nice so don't be shy). However, the course felt like a lot of nonstop work. After week 3, we had quizzes and papers due every other week (all on MONDAY). One week we would have a quiz, the next week a paper due, then another quiz, then another paper, etc. So it all felt quite stressful. Also, the quizzes were pretty hard. The class average on a lot of them was around a 70%, since most of the questions are ambiguously worded. BUT Mesghina does this cool thing where after each quiz you get to work with your peers to retake it, and that group retake can account for 70% of your grade for that quiz. So, you can still leave with a solid A pretty easily. Also, she grades papers really leniently, so not to worry. You can 100% get an A, but you might be pretty stressed while doing it.",
                    "33": "i was really excited for this course because i love personality and overall it was pretty good. prof mesghina is super cool and nice. we have multiple choice canvas quizzes in class for assessment which has an individual portion and group portion. study your notes before hand and you'll be okay. some of them are kind of tricky but with the group weight and the fact you can drop one quiz its totally fine. we have participation through completion check questions. main part of the class is a character assessment paper you work on throughout the course on yourself. its cool because at the end you have like a 12 page paper about yourself. i do feel slightly unsatisfied by this course because i do feel like there was a lack of depth in some of what we learned and i kind of feel like im not walking away with a ton. it felt kind of surface level – i'm not really sure why or what could have been fixed. it might be nice to have had some other readings about personality in context rather than most of the academic readings we were doing.",
                    "34": "This class was amazing. If you can take it, I highly recommend it. The only thing I would watch out for is that the quizzes are kinda difficult sometimes.",
                    "35": "The professor was super fun and nice. She is very in tune with how the class is feeling and brings a fun, youthful energy. The lectures were great, many of the topics though are very nuanced and don't have a clear definitive answer as to what personality is, which made some things difficult to understand. She also let us take quizzes with classmates which was super nice and helped us learn more through collaboration.",
                    "36": "Dr. Mesghina is a great professor and this class was very good at balancing being a traditional lecture and also motivating students to engage with content in nontraditional ways. Most stuff was participation/effort graded and our quizzes had a group portion afterwards that allowed you to \"make up\" for your grade, so even though the quizzes were quite hard the final grade didn't suffer as much. If you're genuinely interested definitely meet with her and do some work outside if you want to fully understand and learn the topics because sometimes the composition of the class (200–level with a lot of nonmajors/nonminors) can stifle your understanding a little. Very interesting course, though more of a basic overview than anything in–depth/nuanced, and could have definitely done more with articulating how on a meta level personality is problematic, especially regarding personality disorders. Again I think the intended audience kind of holds the material back, but it's an \"easy\" class as long as you put in some effort and is definitely worth taking!",
                    "37": "Take this class with Mesghina. She's great. The quizzes are sort of hard but the group portion helps you out. The character assessment papers aren't bad and can be kind of fun. I really liked this class.",
                    "38": "I loved this class! It was very interesting. Even though it was challenging at times, Professor Mesghina is a great lecturer and super engaging.",
                    "39": "Prof. Mesghina is actually the best ever. She makes this class so fascinating and her teaching method is modern and BEYOND effective.",

                    "41": "You have to take this class with Mesghina. She is amazing, so on top of her stuff, and is so clearly invested in her students education. She is gracious in grading. There were four quizzes that were 70% group and 30% individually scored and three character assessments that are relatively short and very fun to write. Other than that, this class is not that much work while still helping you learn a lot. Readings were always interesting, though not necessary to do well in the class. If it weren't for my other classes, I would have done more of them.",
                    "42": "Prof. Mesghina would have us participate in group activities during class and have group quizzes after the individual. She was very enthusiastic and incorporated songs into our topics for class. She also never missed a day of being well–dressed. In conclusion, she slays.",
                    "43": "Great class. Professor Mesghina is really knowledgable and curious and also makes class fun.",
                    "44": "I went into this class super excited because I have always been super interested in personality psychology. Professor Mesghina is a great lecturer; she's hilarious, engaging, and has clear slides and explanations. However, I didn't really learn anything new in this class, but I will say it was very very fun. Applying personality concepts we learned in class to ourselves was cool, and there was plenty of class engagement and discussion. Very easy A; a couple short character essays and partner/group quizzes. Overall, I really recommend this class as an easy, fun, and introspective psych course!",
                    "45": "Not my favorite subject, less concrete concepts as personality research is not fully developed yet. The professor is truly amazing however. There are no exams, bi–weekly quizzes with individual portions and group portions, and bi–weekly cumulative paper where you analyze your own personality.",
                    "46": "I would highly recommend this course! Mesghina is one of if not the best professor in the psychology department; she makes it easy to stay engaged in the course content and teaches in a way that's understandable. As for the course, there's three written assignments (graded fairly) and 4 quizzes (lowest one gets dropped). The only other part of your grade is participation. All of the course content was super interesting as well!",
                    "47": "I really liked the class and instructor",
                    "48": "Prof Mesghina is very engaging and passionate about the course topic. The lectures and slides are very helpful in breaking down the timeline and certain concepts. It is not an easy A since the papers are complex and require lots of critical thinking and understanding about the very nuanced topic, but with work it could be."

The three papers were also not too bad, you just need to start early.",

Class topics are interesting and essays (3) don't feel like busy work – more like interesting argumentative pieces. It was nice not having to worry about number of sources – it's always \"find 1 source and read these 2, and then make an argument.\" Other than the essays, you have readings (usually 1–2 hrs a week) which come from the textbook (which is surprisingly enough really engaging to read) and research papers (which I feel like I got a lot better at reading just by practice and trial+error). Chung is super easy to talk to, and does really fun discussion activities at the end of class that feel like a combination of practical implementation of what you've learned and psychoanalyzing stories of people.",

I took a psych class in the fall before declaring a psych major, and I took this class alongside Psych 201. Professor Chung is an incredible lecturer and she makes the 9:30am class–time exciting and worth waking up for. Her case studies and personal stories are insightful and actually engaging, and the content is interesting while not being too challenging. As long as you don't procrastinate the papers, the pace of the course is great with 2 exams and 3 papers, one of which is due after the final. Always ask for help if you need it, and they will meet you where you are and help you succeed.",

There are readings you're supposed to do, but you can get away without doing them, but even if you do, the book for this class is actually pretty interesting and fun to read. Since you don't really have to worry that much about assignments/tests you can really just focus on the material, which is nice because it's genuinely very interesting. Professor Chung is a great lecturer, she's funny and she helps make all of the concepts easy to understand and digest.",

It was very interesting to learn about the different parts of the personality though, and while it was difficult, I'm ultimately glad that I took the class.",

BUT – for people that do not love MQ and typical test structure, this is not for you. There are 3 essays throughout the quarter which are fine, but the mid term and final make up the largest portion of your grade.",

Professor Chung is a GREAT professor, she's an engaging lecturer and is always available to help students on assignments or tests, so if you can take this class with her I would highly recommend it! That being said, I really enjoyed the first half of the quarter, but the assignments in the second half were not spaced out, so after the first midterm I was working a lot more on this class than I should've been for a fun elective. A lot of the class was memorization for the most part, but the papers and tests were challenging, so you definitely should prepare for those way in advance. Everything was super doable, so don't let this deter you from taking it because the content was super interesting and applicable to real life. Just be prepared to spend more time on this class than you may think, but I would recommend!",
                    "15": "I thought this course was really fun, although it was quite formulaic. A lot of the topics, although varied and insightful, followed a similar structure – seeing how different factors of the Big 5 personality model influenced whatever the topic was (physical health, psychopathology etc.). This made it seem a little less interesting at times. For the exams, small details on the slides were also considered to be important to know as well. Overall, 3 essays + 2 exams, I thought it was pretty doable since everything is quite spread apart. Just maybe start revising for a exams a little early. TAs + Professor Levy Chung were super helpful when it came to exam review questions or essay help.",
                    "16": "Chung makes lectures pretty interesting for being a 930am and the content is really interesting because of how applicable it is to life. Exams are tough and very specific, so know the content well. Go to office hours because she is super helpful there and clarifies a lot about content and assignments.",
                    "17": "This class was okay. Expect to have to put in a lot of time outside of class reading journal articles and the textbook if you want to feel like you actually know anything come exam time. I usually just relied on slides/class notes to study and really really struggled on exams and papers. The actual exams are long and the multiple–choice sections are unnecessarily tricky (half the answer choices are basically the same). With that said, the actual content is fairly interesting (though honestly felt repetitive) and Professor Chung is very kind and incredibly smart. Take this if you're super interested in psych but maybe not just as a random distro, as it's a lot of work.",
                    "18": "Prof Chung was great, the course was interesting and not too hard, but still reasonably challenging",
                    "19": "This course was a good dive into the complicated nature of our personalities. Prof Chung is nice and a great lecturer and has detailed slides. Most of the information you learn in this class, however, is intuitive and seemingly obvious. Preparing for the exams was difficult because there was no list of questions or topics we should know but rather you just had to memorize all of your notes and her slides. Because so much was intuitive, it was hard to tell what hard facts you did have to know. There were 3 formal essays and 2 exams which is manageable but most of the work load piles up at the end of the quarter which is something to keep in mind. The course was basically pure memorization like most Psych classes. Although I know more about personality now than before I took the class, the difference is not substantial. Most of the content was centered around the Big 5 and its facets.",
                    "20": "Honestly more work than I wanted for a fun psych class to take with my more challenging other coursework, but still not a lot of work. Exams and essays are easy to do well on. Information was sometimes interesting but sometimes felt like common sense which caused me to zone out.",
                    "21": "amazing class! prof Chung is awesome. Definitely a challenging class – 2 exams and 3 papers",
                    "22": "Kind of hard course because of the dense amount of material. Attendance is not required (had 1 random bonus attendance day after 1st exam, and attendance is mandatory and recorded on exam days), but strongly encouraged because a lot of what’s on the exams and essays are what she says in class, and it helps when you listen to the examples she gives too because the exam SAQ’s might ask for examples. Work on the essays in advance, there are lot and it will all build up. The 2nd exam is particularly tough because of the more dense content and heavier application of the traits learned in the first half of the course, and that it is after a larger paper is due, so study in advance. 3 papers and 2 exams. Papers are graded fairly, but still hard. Ask for paper extensions much in ADVANCE (like the start of the quarter) if you know you’re going to be busy. They will not grant extensions for the 3rd and final paper.",
                    "23": "I LOVE PROFESSOR CHUNG &lt;3. She is my favorite. 215 is not an inherently easy course, you definitely have to study and should pay attention but despite being a 9:30 I am always engaged because Dr. Chung is a great and super interesting/funny lecturer. She is very flexible and answers questions how you need and just overall great. Readings not necessary (for me) and there are 2 exams, 2 bigger assignments, and the final paper so overall workload is very manageable",
                    "24": "This is an ok class, not super engaging lectures. Exams are super broad, but not in depth, pretty difficult to prepare for.",
                    "25": "This course was very interesting in the sense that you learn a lot but also not so much. What I mean by this is that in lecture, there is a lot of information being told to you very quickly and with examples, which are helpful and interesting to listen to, but when it comes time to study for the exams, it can become overwhelming trying to understand and imbibe so much material. I struggled with having the material stick despite being very interested in the topic and putting in the work. My recommendation would be to read the textbook, which itself was actually quite a pleasant read, and go to class and office hours when the material is not sticking. Aside from that, Prof. Levy Chung is a very engaging lecturer and cares a lot about students doing well. She understands that psychology can be a lot of memorization and understanding very abstract concepts, so she is very open to questions and explaining things in different ways. Sometimes I felt she was perhaps overexplaining a concept, but in retrospect, it was always very helpful to understanding the material. For coursework, there were 3 essays and 2 exams, as well as reading for every class. The essays were interesting to write, but the last two were very centered on psychological research, so if you struggle with understanding research journals, do reach out to Prof. Levy Chung as she helps you go through them. Overall, it is a very interesting class to take, but be aware that it may require more work than you may think.",
                    "26": "I really enjoyed this class. Was interested in the subject beforehand and was very fulfilled. Very organized and great class materials. Lectures were awesome.",

                    "28": "Would definitely recommend taking this with Professor Chung she is a very engaging/enthusiastic professor and really cares about her students. Personality is one of those topics when sometimes concepts aren't very clear/organized so at some times it felt like the content we were learning was just intuitive, but still interesting class. Essays graded pretty harshly though.",
                    "29": "I loved this class! Professor Levy Chung was amazing—really engaging lectures and very approachable in office hours. 3 essays and 2 exams, but overall all of the assignments were manageable. Highly recommend!",
                    "30": "Take this class!!! It is super engaging and while the papers and exams do make you think, what you are learning is super interesting. Professor Chung is so nice and always makes lectures entertaining even at 9:30. You definitely do have to study for the exams and should do the readings (most of it is covered in class, but not all). The papers are fair assessments of learning and the first one especially is fun to write.",
                    "31": "This course was very interesting, and the workload was very manageable. Honestly one of the best classes I took. However, I found the exams to be awfully tricky, as the multiple choice questions would really try and trick you.",
                    "32": "Great class, professor Chung is amazing!",
                    "33": "This course is amazing. I highly recommend taking this. It has very little out–of–class work, yet you still feel like you learned a lot. The material is very interesting and few assignments are very thought–provoking. The text and readings for the course are a bit dense and there isn't exactly a textbook that covers all the topics one–to–one, but it's doable.",
                    "34": "The professor did a great job at expaining class material, the material was really interesting and applicable to real life. Generally, I would highly recommend this class.",
                    "35": "Overall, this is a great class to take for anybody interested in psychology. Prof. Chung is an awesome lecturer, and she gives fair, genuinely interesting assignments. The grading is definitely not easy, but there are always opportunities to attend office hours and check in, and it is definitely possible to succeed if you put in the work.",
                    "36": "If you are interesting in psychology of personality, take this course! If you are looking for an easy A, do not. Although manageable, the workload is pretty heavy for a psychology course and a lot is dependent on how well you do on the exams. I found Professor Chung's exams very challenging, mostly because her multiple choice questions are very difficult. Again, if you are interested in the topic, do not be afraid to take it. But if you want a lighter course, do not.",
                    "37": "Take this class with Prof. Chung!!! Such a cool class, and Prof. Chung is AMAZING!! She's so nice, super engaging, and makes lectures enjoyable to go to. 3 papers which are relatively straightforward (but definitely require some time), and two non–cumulative exams which are pretty straight memorization.",
                    "38": "This class is great! If you are interested in psychopathology and personality disorders along with personality this class would be amazing. However, it definitely was harder than I thought. The exams had averages in the below 80s most of the time and they are a mix of multiple choice and a bunch of written questions/case studies. You definitely will need to put in the work. My only critique would be that the slides are very very bare. If you are not there in class to hear what she says or miss a point or two the slides will be practically useless. I would love for there have been class recordings or more in–depth slides/outlines.",
                    "39": "Pretty good class! The content can be a little boring (and like common sense) at times and you definitely get out of the class what your put in. However, I would recommend this class if you need an easier class to balance out your schedule.",
                    "40": "Pretty interesting class (I'm a psych major for reference). Chung was enthusiastic and good overall, but she went pretty fast with the slides. Slides could be pretty confusing upon re–reading also.",
                    "41": "Super interesting class, kind of hard tests. Had three papers and two tests overall.",
                    "42": "not an easy a course – definitely have to put in effort to get good grades. lectures are highly unmissable, as most of the lecture material is given verbally with little info on the slides, so you have to show up to actually understand. 3 papers, 2 tests. a lot of detailed questions, one thing that really bothered me was the lack of practice problems given so i would always feel iffy before tests, not sure if i over or underprepped",
                    "43": "Professor Chung is AMAZING! She's a great lecturer, clearly very knowledgeable, and makes the 9:30 lecture worth attending.  There are two exams (non–cumulative) and three short papers– everything is graded fairly and the courseload is rarely overwhelming.  Great course if you're looking into majoring in Psychology.",
                    "44": "Format was 2 exams, 3 papers. I feel like this course would have been better with only 2 of each, since it felt like we were constantly worrying about an upcoming paper at the same time as we were studying for an exam (and this is the only 200–level psych class I've taken that's had so many papers). The topics were interesting, though, and Prof. Chung is a great lecturer.<br><br>The class isn't the easiest psych class, but it's definitely manageable. I might be a little biased because the time commitment is just studying for exams and writing papers, but I haven't written many papers in the past few years, so it takes me a bit longer. However, I think if you're interested in personality psych, this will be a great class for you (and even if you're not, it's still a good class).",
                    "45": "This is the worst class I've ever taken at Northwestern. The grading is super weird (e.g., deducting points for saying \"this paper argues\"), and the content is just kinda pseudo–science. 3 papers (4 pages) and 2 exams.",

Office hours were often cancelled or you’d show up and nobody would be there. When you went there were less helpful than other classes and would not give feedback on your ideas. There is no real schedule and you randomly find out dates of quizzes which you do get 5 days to do. I don’t know why we can’t get a full schedule in advance like we do for every other class. Quizzes were super detailed and specific and required intense reading and notes for each chapter. Questions were poorly written and at least the practice questions were from Quizlet and often unclear. It felt unreasonable to need to set up with lockdown browser and a webcam for these little quizzes. I would’ve preferred midterms or taking quizzes in class honestly. I did appreciate that we got exam questions in advance and that we got to vote to narrow them down. But overall I would not take this class if you don’t have to. I’ve taken many harder psych classes and will probably get a worse grade in this one because of how the class is evaluated.",

The topics were pretty interesting and the prof uses a lot of examples that really help you remember the concepts. She makes everyone with a laptop sit in a designated section of the room, and (as someone who doesn't use a laptop) I really liked this. The homework is your choice of 3 out of 6 short essays. I got these out of the way fairly early in the quarter, so it wasn't too bad. Other than that, most of your grade comes from Canvas (Lockdown Browser) quizzes that you take on your own after she finishes lecturing on each topic.",
                    "5": "this class was a lot of work (10 quizzes and drop one, 3 papers, and a final with long answer qs) but so worth it if you're interested in the material. broaders is super helpful in office hours and gives a lot of extra credit if you go to class",
                    "6": "Broaders is a great lecturer. Readings felt kind of long and I personally ended up taking too many notes because we didn’t have a study guide and I wasn’t sure what would be on quizzes. Doing the readings is also helpful for writing essays. Sometimes the quiz questions felt overly specific but if you do readings, go to class (which also gets you a lot of extra credit points) then you will be okay. I would recommend doing the practice quizzes more than once because some of the questions will appear on the actual quizzes.",
                    "7": "The course overall was really interesting, and I loved the different video clips we watched during class. There was an extra credit activity for basically every lecture that would count toward our formal quiz grade, so that was definitely nice. The formal quizzes themselves were not that difficult if you read the textbook and went to the lectures, and you kind of have to go to lectures since they aren't recorded. The homework assignments were sometimes graded pretty strict, but that might be more dependent on who your assigned TA is.",
                    "8": "The content of the course was fine, but its structure was not. The module quizzes were honestly the worst part about the course. The lack of due dates made it very difficult to anticipate one's workflow and plan for it because the quizzes only became active after Prof. Broaders finished teaching that module. We had weeks where we didn't have any module quizzes and weeks where we had three (despite there being 10 quizzes that would align easily with the 10 weeks in the quarter). Honestly, it felt like the instructor struggled to keep to a schedule that got pushed onto students in the class. The questions on the quizzes were very convoluted and often about very insignificant points mentioned in the textbook. The point of them was to check if you read carefully enough to remember every possible detail about the textbook, not if you actually understood the material, which felt pretty detrimental to long–term retention and actual learning. Would've preferred scheduled midterm exams, which would've made it easier to plan and study for over the quarter. Questions on module quizzes rarely reflected the class (entirely about readings), and readings were much better at explaining concepts than lectures. So really, the only point of attending class was to get extra credit points (which was nice and honestly a big help). Speed of grading also could be improved for homework, having ungraded assignments on the day of the final is not great. Overall, I wasn't a fan, but it was doable if you had to. But really, there are better courses out there",
                    "9": "A LOT of work. However, great instructor and you will learn about child development more than ever before. I actually loved going to lectures.",
                    "10": "This class is way more time consuming and difficult than it should be. Broaders just made assignments and essay prompts more complicated than they should have been. The quizzes were so tedious, especially because there were so many and they were pretty in depth from the chapter (which was long and hard to memorize). It sometimes felt that she didn’t respect our time because of how often the quizzes and essay–type homeworks were.",
                    "11": "Professor Broaders isn't the most engaging but that doesn't mean she's bad at all. She knows what she's talking about and gives extra credit in every lecture so you have a little incentive to attend lecture, plus they aren't recorded. Overall, it's not an easy A but it's not a hard class at all, no midterms just lockdown browser quizzes that make up like 40% of your grade.",
                    "12": "Broaders has an inflexibility in the way she teaches large classes that really turns me off from her style.",
                    "13": "hard grading",
                    "14": "While I love that midterms were non–existent, this class is pretty time consuming: 10 quizzes (lockdown browser), 3 essays, and a final exam essay.  If you have a busy schedule, this might not be the best class for you, but otherwise you should know: if you have to choose between reading the textbook and going to class, read the textbook! In my opinion, the amount of work required for this class is excessive, but it isn't particularly difficult work, so take your pick",
                    "15": "This course was so interesting and Professor Broaders is great. This class is not that easy and the workload can be a bit heavy at times but because the content is so interesting it feels pretty manageable.",
                    "16": "This is a really interesting class, and Broaders is an excellent prof. Assuming the course is arranged in the same way, there are no exams, and instead 10 \"formal quizzes\" which you take on a lockdown browser outside of class. You have to memorize a lot of material, but the formal quizzes give you the flexibility to do it on your own time. Lecture is really engaging and the textbook reading are pretty interesting as well. I took this class for a neuro group A requirement, and it is super interesting, but not an easy A (you need to put in work). The only downside is that the formal quizzes mean you spend a lot of time studying and the homeworks are graded super harshly (but you only need to do 3 of them). If you show up to class (Broaders gives extra credit points for just showing up), set aside the time to do the reading and study for the formal quizzes, you will succeed (and learn a bunch along the way!)",
                    "17": "I did enjoy this class and I would recommend attending all classes to not only keep up, but because there are extra credit opportunities and the material is taught in an engaging way in class. However, I do wish the quizzes and homework leaned more on what was taught in class rather than in my opinion inconsequential facts and tidbits from the textbook. Many times, it would feel like nothing I had learned in class could actually help me on assignments which was honestly quite demoralizing. The material taught in class is very interesting though and I did enjoy Professor Broader's instruction.",
                    "18": "I would only take this class if you are required to do so, if  this class is not a requirement and you are interested in psychology for the fun of it  or for a minor I wouldn't take this course.  The structure of this course makes it  almost impossible to succeed. The weekly (sometimes twice a week)  quizzes are worth 40% of your grade which means you are struggling to memorize content rather than learn it. The quizzes also are extremely difficult so I wouldn't expect to do well on them unless you put tons of work into memorization.  The class is lecture heavily and unengaging.  I was more worried about keeping grade up as everything is graded so harshly rather than learning the content.  The grading is extremely harsh with no opportunity for corrections. Our final exam is 4 essay questions  (chosen out of 19 questions)  but we get almost no help or guidance on them. We were incentivized to stay for an extra class during reading week because if we didn't go to that class we wouldn't know the questions the professor was thinking about putting on the final.  This class is incredibly stressful and finicky, they choose specific things to focus on when grading and aren't clear about what they are looking for in an essay. The quizzes are difficult and heavily weighted and overall the whole class feels like you can put in every ounce of effort into it and still struggle immensely.",
                    "19": "I really enjoyed the content of this course and I feel like I learned about a lot of topics and in great depth. However grading of the written homework assignments feels very arbitrary as there is no visible rubric. I also understand wanting to encourage attendance but I wish that lecture slides were either posted beforehand or that the lecture was recorded for viewing afterward for notetaking.",
                    "20": "Probably wouldn’t take this class again if I had the choice, I took this class as an elective and definitely not an easy A. Quizzes were all based on long textbook readings and you really have to know your stuff because questions can be super specific (and they're lockdown browser). Spent too much of my time doing readings and studying for quizzes. She drops your lowest quiz but it doesn’t mean much because they’re like 10 or so quizzes. If you don’t want heavy readings then don’t take this class.",
                    "21": "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!! <br><br>I was told this class was ok in the past, but has gone downhill this year. There is at least a quiz a week. They're lockdown browser and the actual quiz is WAY harder and more niche than the practice ones she posts. It feels like you're being tricked even after studying for hours. You have to write three of the papers out of 8(?) options and they are graded HORRIBLY  by the TAs. Expect to be getting in the 60s–80s on those even if they are well written. The professor is not very engaging and doesn't seem too interested in getting to know  or help students. Honestly this class is a headache and probably will end up being one of the most frustrating I take over my entire NU career :(. The topic could be interesting and I enjoyed the videos, but beyond that was very disappointed. Final is an in class hand–written paper.",
                    "22": "I really enjoyed this course. The way it was structured was unique and relatively stress free, and the content was incredibly interesting.",
                    "23": "It was great!",
                    "24": "This class is definitely difficult. Professor Broaders teaches only about 25% of the material, and the rest of it comes from the textbook/other readings and videos. You NEED to do ALL of this extra reading to do well. There are quizzes at the end of every module (so you end up having them at least once a week or even every few days), and the quizzes ask about a lot of things that come from the textbook, even down to the specific ages/amount of time that EVERYTHING happens, which is extremely hard to keep track of because there is SO MUCH MATERIAL. In addition to the quizzes there are 3 required homework papers, and the TAs are instructed to grade them very harshly, and there is a final in–class essay exam. With that being said the content was interesting, there was just so much of it that that got overshadowed by how overwhelming it was.",
                    "25": "It was important to me that I did learn something I didnt know before, and since I know not much about development psych, it was a lot.",
                    "26": "Professor Broaders is an extremely enthusiastic professor who does an excellent job at getting students interested in the material. That said, this is a very challenging class; it often feels like it is not enough even to attend all lectures and do all of the assigned readings in order to do well. You really, truly have to apply yourself in this one to get an A. It is quite challenging, but also rewarding in the end.",
                    "27": "Great class if you're interested in Psychology. One of the worst classes you could possibly take if you just want to get through a distribution requirement.",
                    "28": "This class is a challenging one, but I really loved it. I was already interested in developmental before taking this class, but I liked it even more after the course. Prof. Broaders expects a lot out of you; you have to complete the readings, attend lecture, and watch videos to succeed on the formal quizzes (what we had instead of midterms). The homework essays definitely depend on your TA; I had a very tough TA, and I did poorly on the first essay. However, after going to office hours and seeing what he expected, I was able to do well on the following ones.",
                    "29": "I would be lying if I said I didn't feel like this class took thirty years off of my life. I dedicated every waking hour trying to stay on top of the readings, practice quizzes, and formal quizzes. Not only is the course overly demanding in that respect, trying to navigate the especially critical grading of the homework (3 3–pg assignments) proved especially difficult. Although I did enjoy not having a midterm and learning such interesting material, I would just be prepared to dedicate a lot of additional time to managing the large amount of work/memorization. Also, the final exam is essay based––flashback to AP exams––so do with that information what you will.",
                    "30": "This class was an insane amount of work for a 200 level course. For each of the 10 modules, there was a 25 question quiz that required you to fully know the lectures and textbook chapter in unbelievable detail. Along with that, there were 3 papers throughout the quarter along with a final. The lectures are well put together with great clips and the prof usually gives extra credit but the workload does not make up for that.",
                    "31": "Really good course but a lot harder than I was expecting. You HAVE to do the readings or else you will do bad, but which pretty annoying when there were 40+ pages of reading per module.",

Aside from that, the lectures are very engaging as Prof Broaders is a very good lecturer, with little discussions and activities/videos spread throughout to maintain attention. There are two exams and an optional final, as well as 4 2–3 page papers on dates you can choose throughout. The grading for the papers is harsh, but not overly difficult.",

I thought the short answers on the midterms were graded very harshly considering how little time you get to complete them. Besides that I thought Prof Broaders was a very engaging lecturer and very knowledgable! Would recommend this class!",
                    "4": "This course consisted of discussion questions (you could choose to do 5 out of 8, and your lowest would be dropped) and 3 exams (your lowest would be dropped). For the exams, definitely use the practice mini–quizzes and do them as many times as you can as I found this to be the most helpful study resource. I found classes to be engaging especially when we were able to watch videos of children participating in the studies that we were learning about.",
                    "5": "This class was pretty manageable, with 2 midterms and an optional final to replace one. There is a lot of extra credit offered so be sure to attend as many lectures as you can. Discussion papers were inconvenient and difficult to get a 20/20 on but were pretty easy to get at least a 92 on. The practice quizzes were very reflective of exam content.",

However, Professor Broaders is one of the worst professors on this campus. She has a good teaching style, but on a personal level she does not know how to treat students with respect.",

                    "10": "I actually loved this class and Professor Broaders! The content was very interesting to me (I took this class for the Teaching Licensure program), and Broaders did a great job using materials in class (videos, etc) to help illustrate points. There are also a ton of extra credit opportunities if you just attend class and watch the videos outside of class if/when she says to. I didn't find the class particularly difficult, and found it pretty easy to get an A. Also, BUY/RENT THE TEXTBOOK. It actually is so helpful and so much of the content is explained really well in it. Furthermore, the questions in the back of the book and the questions in the practice quizzes often ended up on exams, so do a bunch of those.<br>Practice quizzes on Canvas = 7% (you just need to get above an 80% on each one) / complete 4 of the 8 discussion question assignments = 16% / exams = 77%. There are two midterms and one final, but only your highest two are counted towards your final grade, so if you do well on the midterms, you can skip the final",

I had already taken it, so this class was mostly just a recap of stuff I had already learned and relied on the pedantic memorization of psych facts as opposed to really delving deep into critical thinking. In short, useful for MCAT takers, a little bit annoying otherwise.",
                    "13": "I would not recommend this class. It wasn't engaging, the exams were really challenging and material was really hard to follow. I had higher expectations.",
                    "14": "This course was great! I was already interested in learning about child development, and this course definitely did not dissapoint! There is a large focus on the first few years of development, so if that interests you, I would highly recommend the course as a broad overview of developmental concepts! Plus, developmental psychology is such an important topic to learn about, especially if you want to be a parent later in life. Learning *empirically supported* styles of parenting and how different interactions can affect children's cognitive, social, and emotional health is critical.  Professor Broaders did quite a good job designing a broad overview of developmental techinques and important topics. We unfortunately did not get to the last topic, gender development, in time, since we had run a little bit behind schedule toward the latter half. She encouraged us to handwrite our notes (which I usually do not do), and I believe it yielded some pretty signfiicant results! If you take the class, I recommend trying hand–written notetaking, even if you usually write notes on your laptop. It will feel overwhelming at first, but you learn to engage with the most important parts of the material, and handwriting really does improve academic performance according to research studies. If you do choose to take notes on a laptop, you will sit on one side of the room, as she cited research that shows that sitting next to people who use laptops actually decrease academic performance.  Her use of empirically–backed teaching strategies and classroom management strategies is very cool to see, and I feel like it worked for me! The course has two midterm exams and an optional final exam (drop lowest grade), practice quizzes that you only need to get 80% on to get full credit, and discussion questions (choose 4/6–7).",
                    "15": "If you stay on top of the readings/ not taking this class should be more than doable. Class was engaging and the assignments, while sometimes graded harshly, were very doable in the time frames allotted.",

                    "18": "Going into this class I honestly thought it was going to be much harder than it ended up being after reading CTECs from previous quarters. Throughout the course you are responsible 4/~9 reading responses that were offered throughout the quarter in which you summarize a given reading/video and offer some relevant discussion questions to the field of developmental psychology.  Additionally, there are 3 exams throughout the quarter, only the highest 2 count, so I didn't end up taking the final which ends up being pretty common after the first 2 midterms; the first two midterms are about 60 multiple choice and ~2/3 Free Response Essay question, only focused on the content covered in each half of the class. The final is over 100 questions all multiple choice, but is a cumulative exam unlike the first two.  There are also practice quizzes for the midterms which each unit of them due the day before the midterm, you only need to complete these to an 80% threshold, but I would recommend doing them more times than is necessary as many exam questions came directly from the quizzes. Overall I would say the most important part of the course is attending and paying attention during lectures, there are plenty of opportunities for extra credit offered in class, so there is extra incentive to go!",
                    "19": "I really liked this class! Definitely go to lectures because you will miss important information if you don't and also there are lots of opportunities to get extra credit if you go. Flexibility with the discussion questions (ie you only have to do 4/8) and exams (do not have to take final if you are happy with you grade after the two midterms) is really helpful.",
                    "20": "S(cience)TEM baddies, you guys know how to study for this class based on your previous ones. Will say a lot of work, just study a few days in advance.",
                    "21": "The instruction of this course was extremely helpful. It was clear that Professor Broaders wants her students to succeed and offers materials in order to do so. The material reviewed in class was really interesting and often correlated with the readings from the textbook, so the lecture truly solidified the information we were learning on our own. The in class instruction was very clear and there were chances to earn extra credit through participation, etc.",
                    "22": "I truly loved this class – it was an in–depth exploration into a fascinating subject for me. I also loved the outside readings and material, and thought the lecture style was very engaging.",
                    "23": "I liked how the grading worked.",
                    "24": "As a neuro major, this class isn’t bad for fulfilling a Group A elective (below 300 level). There are two non cumulative midterms and one cumulative optional final. She takes the best 2 out of the 3 scores, so if you do well enough on the midterms, you don’t have to take the final. I really recommend trying not to take the final, since there is so much information by the end of the quarter. The midterms are hard enough, because you’re basically just splitting the class in half in terms of what’s being tested. The midterms have about 50 MCQ and 2–3 FRQ questions. She will sometimes hint at what she likes to put on the FRQ, so make sure you go to class!!<br><br>The only real problem I ran into with this class was the sheer amount of material there was to learn. The lectures, combined with the assigned readings, left me with probably 250–300 pages of notes all together. Broaders will emphasize on the first day that you need to do the readings, and she’s (mostly) right. The lectures will often emphasize things the book did not, and vice versa. You will be expected to read entire chapters (~ 40 pgs) before class. If not, you’ll just have to catch up later. I took notes on the readings, which is why I was left with so many notes. You can probably get by without doing detailed notes like I did, but as someone who didn’t have to take the final, I accredit that to doing the readings throughout the quarter and paying attention in lecture. <br><br>As far as assignments go, there are practice quizzes on Canvas for every chapter you read from the book (30 questions) that you only need to complete to 80% in order to get full points for the assignment. Do these quizzes early and often!!! They are REALLY helpful in studying for the multiple choice questions on midterms (the exact questions sometimes show up). There are 8 short (1–1.5 pages) discussion papers that you do on additional readings. You basically just read them, summarize them, and ask a few follow up questions in about 1 page. There are 8, but you only have to do 4 of them, and you get to pick which ones you do. I really recommend doing the earlier ones if you can, since the quarter only gets busier as you go along and you won’t want to do any extra reading. Finally, she often gives extra credit just for showing up to class, whether it be for a survey of some sort or for doing an activity in class. I recommend showing up to every class (like literally every single one). If you noticed, there’s no incentive to do the readings, other than that it will help you in recall when it comes time to study if you’ve already read it and taken notes on it.<br><br>Broaders is a fun lecturer, and pretty engaging, but you really need to go to class and listen, because her notes that she posts after class are not at all helpful. They’re basically just bullet points for HER, not for you. You won’t get any of the important examples or details if you simply write down what’s on the slides after class. On top of that, she does talk quite fast and tends to speed by a lot of slides, so you have to write down what you think is most important (write down the examples and anything that isn’t on the slides!) <br><br>Overall, this class is NOT hard because of the material– if you’re at all interested in child development, and I mean development in every aspect: language, social, cognitive, sensory, physical, and emotional learning, you will find this class fascinating. You’ll also learn about all kinds of theories of development (freud, erikson, ainsworth, etc) and all kinds of interesting ways to study child development. Some of the material is very specific, like what ages certain skills or characteristics or traits show up in development, but Broaders and the book will emphasize the more important ones. This class is difficult because of the amount of material, so make sure you do the practice quizzes early and often, do the readings, and pay attention in class. And go to class for that extra credit!!",

Her lectures are filled with information, but it's always very interesting and usually there are funny baby videos and extra credit opportunities. You're also really set up for success in this class if you just show up and do the work, because there are 4 writing assignments that are really short and easy, and you can do a 5th to drop your lowest score, and there are 2 exams but an optional 3rd if you want to drop your lowest score. The exams are fair, and so is the grading on the written assignments.",
                    "28": "Professor Broaders is a super engaging professor and I would recommend attending an office hours just to chat. Actually reading the textbook was more helpful than class lectures, but the best thing you can do is use the practice quizzes (a ton of times). She is generous with the extra credit in class, which is amazingly helpful. On the downside, textbook readings, discussion questions, and other content to prepare for the course were pretty time–consuming.",
                    "29": "I learned a lot about developmental psych in this course! It's a pretty good class with not much homework, just don't fall behind on lecture and information in general as the whole grade is basically determined by your performance in midterms and final.",
                    "30": "I like that she separated the class by written note takers and computer note takers. It was actually way easier to focus in my section.",
                    "31": "overall its an okay course,  just a lot of lecturing at you with like no room for her to slow down if you need it. best advice is to copy what she says like examples vs typing the slides because that's kind of her structure. this personally was not my favorite teaching style so this class was just not my favorite",
                    "32": "Amazing course– I learned so much. I would say tho– it’s tough to not have any science background and take it (it’s heavy on bio and neuroscience which is very cool but perhaps hard to learn for such a quick turnaround and with very little prior knowledge). I REALLY don’t think this course is for everyone– but as you read this– you can decide if it’s right for you. If you have a busy/stacked quarter or schedule DONT take this class. Dev psych is work, but it’s interesting work. As a neuro major, studies corroborated a lot of what I learned in 206 (systems) which was cool to see. I really enjoyed having Broaders. She’s tough– and makes tough exams– but the key is to take her practice quizzes on canvas so many times that you basically memorize them and also do the practice problems from the textbook at the end of the chapters that were relevant to the readings bc she pulls those questions directly for her exams. I also recommend studying with other people to quiz yourself and eachother. <br><br>It’s not an easy A class– and I think I’ll honestly wind up with an A– cause I’m in biochem rn and would rather not take two final exams in one day– which by the way she lets you drop your worst exam if you take the final– in any case– I feel like not getting the A is not the end of the world for the amount you learn and the interesting content. But if you want – getting the A is totally possible and worth it it just requires drilling questions and making time for this class. If you have any interest in how your brain/emotions/personality came to be the way you are today and you’ve heard of a neuron/how it works, or if you are like I wanna be a good parent one day or if you wanna work with children in any capacity, I highly recommend taking this class.  If you’re premed– take this class. In general, it made me more self–reflective about the ways in which my childhood shaped who I am today.",
                    "33": "the content of this class was really interesting, looking at theories of child development, language, cognition, etc. professor broaders is kind of hard to read and her teaching style is both difficult (when she blows through a large topic with few words on the slides so it is hard to catch) and easy to understand (when several videos and in class examples are given). she’s a big fan of extra credit which is nice but two exams make up 77% of your grade which can be rough."

It’s the type of class where if you go to lectures and study the slides, you will do well on the two exams. Additionally, the writing assignments were short and sweet, making this class a bearable, enjoyable experience.",
                    "1": "Professor Nusslock is incredible. He gives such interesting and fun lectures that are full of fascinating content. He frequently ties complex neural processes to everyday activities so the dense parts of the class are still interesting.",
                    "2": "Good class! 85% of grade is based off of 1 midterm and 1 final, but if you study the slides, they're easy.",
                    "3": "I loved this course! Getting into the neuroscience of concepts I had learned in other psych courses gave me a significantly better understanding of them. Best of all, Professor Nusslock made the otherwise complicated course content accessible without sacrificing any of its complexity or meaning. I cannot say enough good things about this course, and highly recommend taking it, especially with Professor Nusslock!",
                    "4": "This is literally the BEST class I have had at Northwestern. I enrolled in this class with absolutely no prior knowledge in biology/physiology/neuroscience and end up enjoying it.",
                    "5": "You learn a lot in this class, but the content is interesting. Do not cram the material though! There are 2 exams with significant weight, which is the only thing that makes this class scary. Professor Nusslock is great! He's a great lecturer, willing to be vulnerable with his students, and very knowledgeable. He also makes sure that anyone who wants to take neuroscience even if they aren't on the waitlist can get in which is so so nice.",
                    "6": "TAKE THIS CLASS FOR A NATURAL SCIENCE DISTRO!!! The CTECs are not lying. Robin really cares about students succeeding (the average on the midterm was a 93%...I'm an Econ major and that literally is unheard of). He holds review sessions before the midterm/final and goes over any questions.....and lowkey gives hints on what the short answer questions will be. Grade made up of 3 short papers (5% each), 1 midterm (40%) and 1 final (45%). Questions really are based off of lecture slides which is so nice.",
                    "7": "This class was great! The lectures are engaging with great slides and interesting content. There is very little work outside of lectures, only 3 small writing assignments for the entire quarter. The exams were also done well, they're very straightforward and explicitly cover the lecture content. You will know everything on the exam so long as you read/take notes on the slides and do the assigned readings. Great class to get a science distro with, not stressful whatsoever and not boring either.",
                    "8": "Excellent nat science distro and Nusslock is just hilarious and so fun. The material is really engaging and he is an amazing professor. Highly highly recommend.",
                    "9": "I loved this course. Professor Nusslock is a magnificent teacher and a great lecturer. It is obvious that he cares about the subject and through that is an incredibly engaging lecturer. There are three papers for the class which are not very time consuming at all. We had one midterm and the final. As long as you study the slides you will be prepared for the exam. It is A LOT of content you're expected to know for the exam, so if you're not interested in this subject studying for these exams may be difficult. I could not recommend this class enough though!",
                    "10": "The best course I have taken at northwestern so far. The teacher is amazing and really passionate and manages to convey the information in a really clear and straightforward way which I understood perfectly without any background in biology. Two non cumulative exams composed of multiple choice and short essays which you can easily nail by learning the slides. Please take this class, especially for natural science distribution requirement as I learned so interesting facts about the brain, which somewhat impacted my perception of the world.",
                    "11": "Robin Nusslock is such a great lecturer: funny, engaging and willing to answer so many questions from students.  While the midterm being worth 40% of our grade was really daunting, it was structured in a very straight–forward way that all you really need to do is study the slides (1 or 2 mcq questions are from the textbook, honestly you don't need to do the readings to do well in this class). You learn a lot in this class but it's definitely worth it.",
                    "12": "great class, although you have to really study for the midterms and final, the tests are no surprise. All questions are based on lecture and readings so just study slides and you will be 100% fine.",

                    "14": "This class is really dense but it moves at a good speed. You are graded on 3 short assignments that take an hour each, one midterm exam, and one final exam. If you study and crunch and cram to memorize all the concepts and all the information a week or a few days before the exam you will learn a lot and do well. I recommend taking this class. Professor Nusslock is also very passionate.",
                    "15": "This class was great if you love learning about the brain and psychology, but, honestly, I am not super super passionate about that and mostly did this for the distro, so this class could be reallyyy painful and have a ton of memorization for me personally. The entire class is on two exams you need to study a lot for. The prof was super kind and helpful and exams straightforward if you study, but it can be painful to memorize literally over 500+ slides before the exams.  LOTS of memorization –– don't take unless you are willing to literally make a 600+ flashcard Quizlet and study that religiously for like 5 days before exams in a cubicle in Main. Painful, but you will learn a TON and the prof is really thoughtful and passionate. Changed my whole understanding of how my brain worked, so, overall, this class has been well worth it.",
                    "16": "Take this class!!! Nusslock is a wonderful professor; he breaks everything down so well and he makes it very interesting. Easily one of the best classes I've taken here.",
                    "17": "good class. memorize slides and you'll be fine on exams, pretty straightforward. exams are worth 85% so a good amount",
                    "18": "There is a lot of content in this class, but Nusslock is a great professor that makes the lectures interesting. The 3 assignments are super easy and besides that, there are only 2 exams total. Review sessions before exams are helpful to get a deeper understanding of the content.",
                    "19": "Great professor, great class, makes you interested in neuroscience even if you didn't have a lot of interest to begin in. Workload is minimal as readings are pretty much optional and you just have three easy 2–page writing assignments throughout the quarter.  Exams are pretty easy if you are on top of the materials (median was 91 for the first exam).",
                    "20": "This class is manageable and good for the psych minor requirement. There is pretty much no work other than the midterm/final. I never did any of the readings, the exams are just on the lecture slides. I had to grind during exam season for this class just because it's so much content but if you study you will be 100% fine. Didn't love this class b/c the content is kind of boring but it fulfilled the requirement and wasn't too hard.",
                    "21": "Good interesting course but it's SO content–heavy. Do not take it as an easy distro. The midterm is worth 40% and final 45%, then there's three writing assignments.",
                    "22": "GREAT SCIENCE DISTRO! Professor Nusslock is so passionate about what he does, it really reflects in his teaching. The material is so interesting and applicable and not too hard to follow even if you aren't a huge science person. Nusslock goes beyond what you need to know for the course and talks about interesting fun facts and experiments. He will always answer our questions even if its just related to the brain. Most of this class is memorization for the two midterms. Everything is on the slides so all you have to do is study them. Attendance is not mandatory and everything is on the slides, but I would recommend going to class and you won't have to cram for the midterms. The first exam is 40% of your grade and made for the class to be successful. I studied for it a normal amount and went to class and got 100%. Its 50 multiple choice and a couple short answer questions. The second exam is 45%. It is non–cumulative but still during finals week. The other 15% is split among three writing assignments, mainly just for participation, you will get 100%. You find a video/article/experiment outside the course about the brain and write a summary, analysis, and connect it back to the course in 2 pages double spaced. Super easy, not very time consuming, and only happens three times the quarter. There are readings for each course, but the texts are just to help you understand the class and there are at most two questions on the exams where you would only be able to find them in the textbook. I wouldn't buy the textbook because it's so expensive. If you want it and can't afford it, the Professor is super understanding and will find you the resources to get it. Overall this is one of the best and not too hard classes I have taken at Northwestern. Take it if you can!",
                    "23": "Good class, very interesting, digestible content and the exams weren't too hard.  The second exam was def. harder than the first one.",
                    "24": "Take this class!! I am a psych major but am more interested in the social side than the science–heavy classes, so I was dreading having to take this class. But Prof. Nusslock is a great lecturer and made the class so interesting. It's an easy A if you just memorize the slides for exams, but beyond that I really enjoyed this class and learned a lot about applying science to psychological topics.",
                    "25": "This was a really good class and a solid science distro! Robin is a great lecturer who makes the material interesting and relevant. The exams were super doable if you study – it's mostly memorization and they aren't out to trick you. I liked this class a lot!",
                    "26": "I, overall, really liked this course. If you do the readings and memorize the slides the exams are very doable. I learned a lot about the brain in a very short time. I do wish we had moved a little faster through the content though.  We never got to the last two lectures which was sad because they sounded very interesting.",
                    "27": "Dr. Nusslock is one of the best professors I've ever had at Northwestern, I genuinely looked forward to every lecture and I appreciated how his grading system worked.",
                    "28": "Great Course! Prof Nusslock is a fantastic professor who conveys his passion in the subject and our success in each class. Content was taught in a very clear manner and facilitated our learning. Class consists of 2 non–cumulative exams and 3 2–page papers. Excellent natural science distro too.",
                    "29": "This course covers a LOT, and it also moves very fast. It's difficult to catch up once you've fallen a bit behind. The exams are easy as long as you study the slides, but there is a lot to memorize so they can be demanding depending on how well you've kept up.",
                    "30": "learned so much in real world sentences of caffeine, drugs sleep, supplements GREAT! teacher so passionate and great. he gives super easy papers that boost ur grade and find something ur interested in! captivating guy and straightforward test no tricks or gimmicks",
                    "31": "The material is interesting but lectures DRAG on cause people keep asking off–topic or personal questions. Makes it difficult to stay engaged, which sucks cause I feel like the prof actually cares :/ but attendance isn't required and the material is decently straightforward",
                    "32": "Great class. Nusslock is awesome and a great lecturer. Review sessions are super helpful. Plus if you've taken AP bio or any bio class the first half of the class is mostly review.",
                    "33": "Nusslock is great! Not a throwaway class but not too much work either",
                    "34": "Definitely recommend this class to anybody looking for a science distro! Professor Nusslock is a really engaging lecturer (among the best I've had at Northwestern) and the exams are designed to be fairly easy if you memorize all the slides (although there is a lot of content)",
                    "35": "great course, i learned so much and prof nusslock is a great lecturer. go to class, take notes, and then a few days before put in a lot of studying and you'll be fine, i did that for the first exam and got a 100 as someone whose home school is SESP (we never have tests). you def have to put effort in, but it should never be too demanding!",
                    "36": "This was a really interesting course.  Professor Nusslock is great and conveys the information very well.  It can be a little nerve wracking that 85% of the grade is 2 exams, but a nice consequence is the workload is not bad at all.  Be warned though, the second exam is definitely harder than the first.  Either way, I really recommend this course, especially to those without a background in neuroscience.",
                    "37": "Pretty good for an intro neuroscience course–– super interesting if you are interested in depression, anxiety, and substance–use.",
                    "38": "PROFESSOR NUSSLOCK IS THE BEST!!! Highly highly recommend taking this class with him. The class is extremely engaging and well organized, probably the most I've ever learned in a single intro class at Northwestern. The lectures are absolutely fascinating. <br>In addition to being top of his field and very published/cited, Professor Nusslock is very friendly, down to earth, entertaining, and cares a lot about his students' success. He also takes extra care to make sure that regardless of your academic background (whether you've taken tons of science/psych or none before), the class is both doable and engaging. The exams and assignments are very reasonable to the course content, and since the slides are so great, it is very easy to study. Take Neuro with Nusslock!!!!",
                    "39": "A lot of the material overlaps with material from the intro to psychology class, so if you have taken that this might not be as interesting.",
                    "40": "pretty easy distro! Nusslock is great, exams straight forward.",
                    "41": "I found this class very interesting and the exams and assignments were fairly easy.",
                    "42": "Prof Nusslock is amazing at what he does. The course material can be very dense, but I always walk out of class feeling like I have learned a lot. Not only is he enthusiastic, he also organizes the class in a manner that helps you succeed in the class. There are review sessions before the exam and the tests are very fair. Exams make up the bulk of your grade and there are 2 non–cummulative exams with both mc questions and short answers. As long as you attend lectures and review your notes, you're going to do fine.",
                    "43": "I learned a lot.  Nusslock made the class awesome! He’s so sweet and passionate about the topics! When studying for the test, it felt like a lot of content. It is a bit challenging, but he makes it fun:) Take this class with him. He is very straight forward. The test cover A LOT, but if you study you can do great. His slides are ver helpful for studying and I love that he is not trying to trick anyone. What we go through is what shows up in the test. He is also very encouraging and you can tell he wants you to do well in his class. You have to put in the effort, but it’s always so interesting. I also love that he answers questions a lot during class because it’s engaging and make everything more interesting! He is so knowledgeable you can tell he is very prepared for this class. I respect him and admire his work.",
                    "44": "LOVE THIS CLASS it is the best and super interesting. Professor is literally so sweet and wants everyone to love and understand neuroscience. His lectures are super engaging and he is very good at explaining everything very clearly, that things I was confused on when previously learned became clear. For exams just need to learn the slides, there are no surprises, exams are super fair, and Nusslock just wants you to learn and enjoy the subject. 3 writing assignments throughout the quarter to help you read neuroscience material outside the course work but don't take much time at all and are basically given as extra credit assignments. Textbook reading is technically required and there will be a couple questions on the exam on textbook material, but defiinitely no necessary to read. No work outside of lectures other than the 3 assignments during the quarter and studying for exams – one midterm and one non–cumulative final.",
                    "45": "This class was a lot better than I anticipated. Robin is an amazing professor, and he made a daunting subject easily understandable. His lectures were super interesting, and the exams are not too hard. They require a lot of memorization, but they're not trying to trick you, which is really nice. Robin clearly wants everyone to succeed, which is relatively easy to do as long as you're willing to put effort into memorizing when it's time for exams.",
                    "46": "One of my favorite courses I've taken at NU! Super fascinating and concepts are made accessible for people with little science background. Exams are very detailed but predictable. If you're a Psych major, definitely recommend taking as a Column B requirement!",
                    "47": "Great course! Take this as a basic science",
                    "48": "Take this class as your science distribution! Professor Nusclock is truly amazing as an instructor, and you can tell how passionate he is. As a non–scientist, things were very approachble",
                    "49": "I loved this class! I say this every quarter about my psych classes but intro to neuroscience was so well taught and definitely my favorite class of the quarter.  Professor Nusslock was great, you could tell he was so passionate about the class and its content. I always looked forward to coming to class and rarely felt bored during class. There were only 3 assignments (2 page papers – double spaced) so there was not much you had to do outside of class. And for exams, there were 2, a midterm and a final (which was just based on the 2nd half of the class but was during finals week) and while the exams had a lot you needed to know. They were not designed to trick you and as long as you knew the slides you were fine. They were very few questions from the textbook, so I would suggest just skimming it, to supplement your studying.",
                    "50": "Difficult for distro",
                    "51": "This class was awesome. I had taken the BME version which was much denser/harder to follow – I would suggest this course for Weinberg students who are interested in learning how brain biology relates to your mind throughout life , or to engineering students who want to be able to take their time and develop a more intuitive understand of the brain/mind links. <br><br>10/10 awesome class, not the easiest but in no way difficult at all – just study a bit  &amp; show up to class and you're fine",
                    "52": "This course helped me a learn a lot about the brain. Professor Nusslock is amazing!",
                    "53": "I absolutely loved this course. Although it is challenging and requires a fair bit of memorization for the exams, it was so worth it. Professor Nusslock is by far one of my favorite professors at Northwestern. He is so passionate about psychology, and this shines through during lectures. He is always available for questions after class and his review sessions for exams are very informative. I would highly recommend this course for psychology majors, and anyone who needs a distro. This is, however, a time–consuming course and I would not enter into it lightly if you have an already heavy courseload.",
                    "54": "Well, this class was a letdown. The sad thing is that it was on the verge of greatness. First off, the lectures are way two dense for twice a week, this should be a MWF class. Coming from engineering, where most of our tests are about applying skills in context, I hated that this class was a lot of memorization. It would be fine if we had better detail on what was critical, but since “everything up until a certain lecture is fair game” it was so hard to prioritize information, especially since there are hundreds of slides! The lack of a practice exam didn’t help things either, another chance to actually actively apply these things missed. I know I can do my own studying like flashcards and blurting, but applying a skill is so much more of a stronger way to learn something. Rote memorization needs to die. I would much rather do stoichiometric chemistry problems then this; we’d be doing math but math in context of science, doing a process that helps us understand a chemical process instead of rereading the same shit over and over until it sticks. I get nothing from memorization, everything I had to learn for the midterm has already left my brain. I hated how it made this fascinating subject boring. Imaging how much more exciting and memorable things would be if we got to do our Golgi stains or neuron drawings a la Ramon y Cajal, or look at a neuron under a microscope, or see action potentials play out with a hands on diorama, or do skits about the characteristics of neurotransmitters…I know that this class is huge, but it should really downsize to have a more personal, hands on approach. Or it can settle in its comfortable mediocrity.",
                    "55": "Prof Nusslock is very passionate about teaching. However, the material was a lot. There is a lot of memorization and not a lot of application. For each midterm, I made over 250 flashcards. However, the exam was multiple choice with a few short answers. It seems intimidating but everything is very similar to the slides. Honestly, its not a bad course to take, but its just a lot.",
                    "56": "Robin is an amazing professor!! He is deeply passionate about neuroscience and makes the course easy to follow for beginners. The course is very content heavy and a lot of memorization. There is a midterm (40%), final (45%) and three small writing assignments (15%). The final is NOT cumulative, but the heavy weighting can be daunting. Overall, this is a very good natural science distro, but only take it if you are comfortable with memorization.",
                    "57": "By far the best course I have taken at Northwestern. I'm a Computer Science major and took this class to fill a distribution requirement, and I'm so glad that I did. Professor Nusslock is truly an outstanding lecturer and makes the course content digestible and interesting.",
                    "58": "Nuzzlocke is wonderful. Absolutely take with him. Readings are not required, other than like maybe 1 multi choice question each test. Test is multi choice + short answer, final is much harder than midterm. First half covers general function of neurons, second half gets into the brain more specific contexts like memory and emotion. A LOT of memorization, so be ready for that. Imo, second half is much more memorization for the sake of memorization, and not as interesting as first half, so be ready to force yourself to study for the final lol. Other than 2 exams, there’s 3 papers th at are double spaced 2 pages about a video, article, and paper respectively of your choice, and basically everyone spends 1–3 hrs doing and then gets full credit on.",
                    "59": "This class consists of a midterm (40%), final (45%), and three short writing assignments (each worth 5%). As long as you study the slides and at least glance at the reading, you should be fine. It really helped me to make practice questions (both multiple choice and written) because most of my own practice questions showed up on the test. Professor Nusslock does not surprise you with what will be on the tests. As a non–STEM major, the material was very manageable. I also took AP Psych which helps a ton with this class, especially the first half with action potentials and neurochemistry. The lectures can sometimes be long, especially if the topic is not of interest to you. If you need a science distro, take this class, but if you are interested in psychology, I wouldn't recommend it because it leans more towards the science side of psychology.",
                    "60": "Tons of content but very interesting topics and Professor Nusslock is an awesome lecturer",
                    "61": "I took this class as a distro and thought it was decent. The course was very well structured and organized and the slide the professor uses to teach are comprehensive and explain the material sufficiently. The exams are extremely fair and you only really need to study the slides to do well. I will say that the concepts are pretty dense and for someone who didn't have any experience with neuroscience beforehand, the material was more bio heavy than I expected (I expected it to be more psych based). Regardless, the class was pretty interesting and I would recommend this it as a distro. Keep in mind that you do have to put the work in and study to do well, but an A is definitely attainable.",
                    "62": "This class was interesting and pretty chill! Not a ton of work load, covers a wide breadth of materials, and not incredibly challenging. The final was a bit harder than I had anticipated just because I found the midterm to have been super easy, so I do wish I studied a bit more for the final.",
                    "63": "It does have a lot of readings, but most are covered in lecture. And for exams there's a lot of memorization especially includes biology and chemistry knowledge, so not an extremely easy class.",
                    "64": "This course is very interesting. A lot of material is covered but exams are straightforwards as long as you study the slides, you are in a good place for exams. I highly recommend the course, teh professor makes it very interesting!",
                    "65": "Clear, enthusaistic",
                    "66": "Professor Nusslock is an amazing. I highly recommend taking a class with him if you get the chance. This course included three easy short papers and two exams. The class is a lot of content, but if you memorize the lecture slides for the exam you should be fine. The exams are very straightforward and Prof Nusslock is not trying to trick you at all. The textbooks readings are not necessary at all, but can be helpful if you don't get a particular topic. Overall, I recommend this class if you're interest at all in neuroscience and the brain.",
                    "67": "The lectures are very interesting and informative and the professor is great. I did struggle a lot with the exams, I wouldn’t recommend this class to bad test takers, otherwise the class is great!",
                    "68": "This class is actually great!! I learned so much and it was all really cool applicable info– sometimes the material gets dense but really knowing the slides is all you need– they're great. Not much work outside of class and all and the exams are super fair!",
                    "69": "Professor Nusslock is exceptional. His eagerness for the class is clear and the class time is incredibly valuable in the learning. It is genuinely one of my favorite classes I have taken here, I would recommend you take this regardless of your major.",
                    "70": "This class was really challenging for me. I ended up not doing so well and not passing the class. Take your time to study well &amp; maybe gather a study group.",
                    "71": "Professor Nusslock is amazing! You learn so much about the brain and I found it super interesting!",
                    "72": "Absolutely the best course I have taken at Northwestern! A must take!!!",
                    "73": "I took this course as a required distro. It was a very challenging class for me. Lectures are long and jam–packed with information– and not recorded. Professor Nusslock designs the exams so that they are all based on information from the slides and the readings. But that means hundreds of slides– sometimes with undefined terms– and hundreds of dense textbook pages. Having a background in neuro would definitely make this class more manageable and make lectures more absorbable. With that being said, I struggled but I worked really hard and should be ending the quarter with an A.  There are three short writing assignments worth 15% total, one exam worth 40%, and one exam worth 45%. No study materials are provided for exams, but there is a review session the night before an exam.",
                    "74": "This course can seem intimidating especially as someone who isn’t in STEM but it’s honestly a really good class. The concepts covered are super interesting and relevant. Professor Robin is a great professor who tries to explain this complex bio concepts in a way that is understandable. The exams are super fair and are based on lecture slides. Only few questions on readings, they are truly just a supplement to enhance your understanding. Definitely recommend this course",
                    "75": "Nusslock is amazing, one of my favorite classes. 3 very easy papers and 2 exams, the papers are basically extra credit and you can write them on basically whatever you are interested in. Exams are super straightforward, but it is important to fully understand concepts.",
                    "76": "I highly recommend this as a column B for the psych/minor. Or a natural sciences distro too (no science background needed to do well, but having prior knowledge can’t hurt either). It is semi–heavy in terms of memorization, but everything is clearly explained. You’ll get an A if you show up to class (it’s not recorded) and study a day or two before the exams. Content was really relevant to my life, and I really enjoyed the lecture about circadian rhythms and my sleep cycle.<br><br>Lectures were very engaging, but the professor tended to answer too many questions. This resulted in us getting behind since day 1, and it was hard to focus with constant interruptions. Reading the textbook was absolutely not necessary for the midterms. But do skim the supplemental articles because those can come up in a few exam questions.<br><br>There were 2 non–cumulative exams, one halfway through the quarter (during class), and the other during finals week. Each exam had ~50 MC and 4–5 FRQs. I thought they were reasonable, fair, and easy to finish in the allotted 80 minutes.<br><br>There was no homework other than three short writing assignments. Everyone gets 100 on those. <br><br>As for grading, the midterms were 40% and 45% of our final grade. The 3 writing assignments were worth 5% each.",
                    "77": "Intro to neuroscience with Nusslock is great. There are some units that are necessarily a little dry, but Nusslock does an incredible job making the course engaging. The topics related to emotions and addiction were really well–presented and interesting.",
                    "78": "I loved this course! It was fun. The exams can be somewhat hard but manageable! I enjoyed this class.",
                    "79": "This is a great course. The professor is so kind and genuinely cares about making science accessible. The only thing is that this is A LOT of memorization (I had around 300 flashcards for each of the exams), but the trade–off is the exams are relatively easy.",
                    "80": "This course is awesome and I'd highly recommend taking it. You learn so much in such a digestible format, and Professor Nusslock is really great at engaging students and keeping your focus. I would highly recommend taking this class. There are three writing assignments (two pages each) and they are 15% of the grade. Each exam is noncumulative and the first is worth 40% and the second is worth 45%. Exams are 50 MC, and 5 short answer questions. If you show up to class, study the lecture slides, and enjoy the content, than an A is achievable as studying becomes less of a chore and actually learning and enjoying learning.",
                    "81": "Valuable class for a psych major looking for a Column B requirement! Though some of the topics can be difficult to understand, this class does make the complexities of neuroscience into a more manageable set of information. No textbook reading necessary – all the material is in the lecture slides. So basically no out–of–class work except for studying right before the exams. The review sessions the night before the exam are super super helpful. Important to attend class, and the lectures are pretty interesting –Prof. Nusslock is pumped up about neuroscience!",
                    "82": "Robin Nusslock is so sweet , and  great teacher! Class was low pressure: 3 easy writing assignments 2 midterms (lots of memorization) but just know the slides and you'll be fine",
                    "83": "One of the best classes I've taken. Robin is AMAZING. Can't say enough nice things about him. It's tough for a 200 level but if you study the slides a LOT for the midterm and final and you'll be okay.",
                    "84": "I appreciated how this course covered both behavioral and biological components of neuroscience. The tests were relatively straightforward following the slides from class, but I would also recommend reading the textbook since some of the exam material is either purely from the book or couples understanding from lecture + the book. Content–wise, this course covered many interesting topics––however, the pace could feel a bit quick at times. I also liked the Writing and Media assignments since they gave me the chance to find articles + media pieces that interested me and related to topics in behavioral neuroscience. Robin is also a funny/silly + learned lecturer, giving effective analogies for specific course concepts.",
                    "85": "Not as easy as people make it sound. The topics are actually quite hard and there are so many random details and words you need to know. Also lectures were very boring.",
                    "86": "This is a great course. You'll learn about, memory, consciousness, sleep, drugs, and much more, and its not too in–depth so the tests are not daunting. If you study the slides and make a quizlet you'll do great on the exams. The writing assignments are basically extra credit so just get them done and you should get a 5/5.",
                    "87": "I thought the final was way harder than the midterm. I wish the grade was made up of more than two exams. It put a lot of pressure on each exam.",
                    "88": "Honestly did not go to a lecture after the first 2 weeks b/c tests are super vocab–based; pretty good class and Nusslock is super passionate about getting people interested in neuroscience so would highly recommend if you need a found disp/distro for natural sciences",
                    "89": "I didnt love this class, but that's because im not huge on biology and all the super specific terminology. the lectures were good, but sometimes boring. professor nusslock is super smart and cares about the content and our understanding of it, but sometimes it seemed like he wasn't able to understand that we were beginners. I wish there was homework because the content is dense and hard to process, and I feel like more homework would've help break it down. there were only 3 assignments and you just wrote about something you either read or watched regarding neuroscience. these assignments were fun, but not helpful in terms of understanding the material. the readings are long, but interesting. there's only 2 tests which in theory is nice but I think 3 would've been better bc there's so much content. just study the slides very well and you should do fine.",
                    "90": "I honestly LOVED this class. Prof. Nusslock is so amazing, he makes all the lectures so interesting, engaging, and makes complicated concepts accessible to people with no science background. There is virtually no work out of class. 3 super short writings, 2 noncumulative exams. The exams are so fair, if you study the slides you will do well. The other readings are not necessary. Would highly recommend taking this class with Nusslock if you can. This class alone made me interested in neuroscience.",
                    "91": "You MUST take this class with professor nusslock if you get the chance. Not only is the material extremely interesting on its own, but professor nusslock has to be the best Professor I’ve ever had at Northwestern.",
                    "92": "Really liked this course! The slides are daunting but if you put in the work to study you will do really well. Nusslock is the goat so it makes it manageable. Take it if your on the fence!",
                    "93": "Absolutely take this class! Whether it be for a distro or for the column B psychology requirement, this is the perfect class to take. Nusslock is an incredible lecturer and person who has the ability to make the content actually engaging. The class is so much more than just learning about individual parts of the brain–– while of course there is that too. Nusslock connects each neuroscience part with a psychological concept. He explains everything thoroughly as well, so it is not necessary to have a strong background in science–– this class is actual made for non–STEM students! You can tell that he is very passionate about what he teaches, and it really draws you in. The class is comprised of two exams (worth 40% and 45% of your grade) and three two–page writing assignments (5% each), though Nusslock has admitted that as long as you complete the assignment, it is essentially a free 100% for 15% of your grade.  The exams are very straight forward as well, deriving primarily from the slides. There are readings, though it is not necessary to do them to do well in the class. If ever given the chance, I cannot repeat enough, definitely take this class!",
                    "94": "This is a very straight forward interesting class! The professor is really passionate and funny! I would highly recommend taking this course.",
                    "95": "Really interesting class, Professor Nusslock is great. It is really memorization–based (but I guess that's how a lot of these intro biology/chemistry classes tend to be). It was fairly straightforward to study for though, and the review sessions that Professor Nusslock hosted were very helpful. The exams were also a REALLY big percent of your grade which I was not a fan of but they were manageable.",
                    "96": "This was a great intro to neuro I took for my CSD neuro requirement. Pf. Nusslock is an amazing lecturer and made class really enjoyable. I appreciated how often he took questions and how he was invested in our learning about the brain. I never did any work outside of studying for the exams and assignments and I did totally fine. Definitely an easy course to pass but very interesting!",
                    "97": "This class was super interesting. The lectures were definitely classic lecture style, but there were opportunities for questions. The few writing assignments we had were informative and allowed us to explore our interests through a neuropsych lens. The amount of people who showed up to this class is a testament to the teaching style.",
                    "98": "This class is almost purely memorization so if you can do that you'll be fine",
                    "99": "This was a pretty solid psychology course, a great column B requirement. The course setup was a little tricky because there are only two exams and 3 short papers, so each assignment holds a lot of weight. Also, previous ctecs from the past said to just study the slides and you will be fine, but a lot of the lectures have over 50 slides and he includes some textbook questions on exams that he doesn't mention in class. I would only take this course if you're willing to put effort in both going to class and staying on top of textbook readings, but it is a pretty easy B+/A– for sure.",
                    "100": "Robin is the best instructor  and I think everyone deserves to take this class",
                    "101": "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is remotely interested, as Professor Nusslock is a great professor. He is very passionate about the subject, and is enthusiastic to teaching it to as many students as possible (he allowed more people in than the enrollment cap because of this). During class, Professor Nusslock is good at explaining complex ideas in a way that makes sense to those who have no previous exposure to the field and his slides are very well–made too. He also fields a lot of questions during class, and works hard to learn students' names in the process which is impressive given the class's large size. Definitely go to lecture to hear him speak, and just make sure you know the slides (the readings and textbook mainly reinforce what was covered in lecture and you don't need to read either in great depth).",
                    "102": "This course is a easy course to take for a science credit. There is practically no homework at all (3 papers 2 pages each paper that took less than 2 hours each time) the only challenging part is studying for the tests. The tests are directly off the slides so if memorize the slides should get an easy A, just a lot of information",
                    "103": "This class felt kind of strange. While it's true that most of the content of the class is contained on the slides, we go over such a vast quantity of concepts and topics that it can be overwhelming to understand, especially given that there are no practice questions available. This led to me going into each exam completely unsure of how ready I was. That said,  the concepts were interesting and Nuslock is nice. Not the worst class, but I definitely won't be taking any similar classes anytime soon.",
                    "104": "This was a great course. Would highly recommend as a science distro or just as a course to take in general. It was super interesting and was also not that demanding. You definitely have to study for the midterm and final exams, but as long as you know the slides, you will do well. Prof. Nusslock makes both the midterm and the final very fair exams. There are usually 2–3 multiple choice questions out of around 50 that reference the textbook. So, if you are fine giving up those questions or making an educated guess, you don't have to read the textbook. There are also 3 two–page writing assignments that you have to do, but they are easy and boost your grade. Overall, would really recommend this class. Prof. Nusslock is an incredible professor – really smart, great at communicating ideas, and always makes himself available to answer students' questions."

                    "2": "Overall, a pretty good and low stress course. There were three non–cumulative exams and two one–page papers. Prof. Horton is really nice and and an engaging lecturer. The content could get a little boring for someone not interested in neuroscience, but overall, not too bad.<br><br>My only real complaint is that the textbook chapters were super long and dense (though admittedly, I gave up reading them after the first week and still got an A–)",
                    "3": "This class is pretty straightforward with 3 non–cumulative exams and 2 research reports. Those are the only grades you'll get from the class so there's not much room to make up for exam points. All the exams are straight from the lecture slides, so you have to come to class and take notes to get the extra information he mentions in class. The slides he post on Canvas is a condensed version of what he presents in class, which is why you have to come to class. The class can feel boring at some times but he demonstrates some psychology trick to keep it a little bit more entertaining.",

Readings not required, but must take good notes in lectures. But if you pay attention and review lecture notes, you'll do fine on the exams, since they are pretty straightforward. Horton is a chill and nice professor. Good class to take to knock out any psych requirements. It's cog psych, so the lecture material can only be so interesting, but it's informative and gives a good introduction to the field.",
                    "6": "Dr. Horton is a great professor! His class is interesting, meaningful, and educational, and I really feel like having only three exams allowed me to really learn and internalize the information, rather than feel forced to learn everything just to forget it after the exam. The exams aren't super hard, just multiple choice and some free response questions but if you study the slides beforehand you should be fine. The two research paper summaries are also super easy and not much work. Definitely take this class!",

All of the content was very interesting to me, as a Neuro major taking this class as a requirement. The exams are very fair if you review throughout the quarter and make sure to use the review guides that he posts! The book is a good supplement, but personally I did not use it outside of the first week of class.",

There isn't any necessary reading, and the study guides he gives for exams are great!!! Definitely use them. Exams are 6 essay questions and 32 multiple choice always.",

                    "11": "This course is a very informative introduction to Cognitive Psychology. It does cover a lot of topics, but if you go to lecture, Prof. Horton is very knowledgeable and explains concepts well with good examples. Go to class, learn the example experiments, and you'll do well.",
                    "12": "TAs and professor are really nit picky about the free response answers, so it's easy to lose points in that section of the exams. Professor Horton's slides are vague and he reads off the slides during lecture but then expects detailed free response answers. Attend class, take notes, quiz yourself on definitions.",

                    "14": "Good course. You don’t have to do any of the readings so there is pretty much no homework outside of class. Tests are fair but covers all the content taught in class. Class is pure memorization of a good amount of content but everything is manageable.",
                    "15": "I enjoyed the material in this class, it is generally pretty interesting but the 1.5 hr long lectures can get a little boring after looking at so many slides of study results. The research reports are simple and don't take too long, and its easy to find an interesting one to write about. The tests are a lot of memorization, but going to lectures will provide you all the needed info on the tests.",

I genuinly felt like I have learnt a lot and if you have the slightest interest in cog psych or just in general want to learn about it, take it. There are 3 exams and 2 reports. The reports are doable just start early and if you email Prof he replies very quickly and gives great feedback. For the exams,  just always know what you are learning about because there is a lot of material. Don't leave it to the last day, study as you go and the exams will be fine",
                    "17": "It was fine, I'd say it's one of the more boring psych classes. But I liked how Professor Horton provided study guides, making it easier to condense your studying. Lectures weren't recorded, but you can miss a few if you're sick without it severely hurting your grade. I took this class as a neuroscience major for my A elective, but honestly, it is like an extension of Psych 110 or IB Psych. I found myself relearning stuff from high school, but to a deeper degree. No quizzes, and the papers are free points if you just follow the instructions. Solid Neuro elective A choice.",
                    "18": "I think this course is not for everyone, as the material can be very complex and hard to understand at times. Additionally, there are a lot of studies to memorize",

Horton is a great professor. I learned so much from the course and can apply the concepts to my own life.",
                    "20": "This was one of my favorite classes that I’ve taken at Northwestern. The professor was great and the topics covered were very interesting. My only complaint was the test format. Lots of questions were more specific than typical questions on other psychology tests I’ve taken in the past. This was a bit frustrating because I had to study a significant amount for each test.",
                    "21": "This was my first Psychology course at Northwestern and was my favorite class of fall quarter! I learned so much about various aspects of cognitive psychology including memory, language, reasoning, and decision making. I love the intersection the course has with cognitive neuroscience and even linguistics. Professor Horton is very knowledgable and does a great job at breaking down all of the research studies so that they are easily understandable. Most of the course is memorization and there are only 3 exams throughout the quarter with 2 short papers. The workload was very manageable and it is easy to do well on exams if you pay attention during lecture. Horton's office hours are also a valuable resource that I don't think are utilized enough so go to office hours and ask questions!",
                    "22": "Overall this course was okay. It was one of the more demanding psychology courses I have taken at northwestern just because it had three exams which is not usual for psych courses and also although it was nice that by the time thanksgiving came around i was done with the class I felt like we had an exam every other week and then on top of that we had two research reports. The professor is eager to help and answer questions/explain.  I didn't love the topics and my passion for psychology is usually what gets me through all the memorisation for the exams so not being that interested in what we were discussing what it a bit for effortful.",
                    "23": "Not the easiest psychology class, but very important for having a good psychology foundation. The class consists of 3 exams and 2 research reports. The research reports were very easy, but the exams were just okay. The wording of the questions can be a bit confusing sometimes, but overall a fair test. It is a lot of content, so you definitely need to study for the exams. Professor Horton was very nice. Lectures weren't always super interesting, but I feel like that can be expected with this type of course.",
                    "24": "This course is super interesting and easy to learn/understand! Horton is a great professor who is willing to answer questions in and out of class. Horton also provides very in depth explanations of all of the concepts and points you in the right direction if you still need help (whether in the book or elsewhere).",
                    "25": "Since the class is based only on three exams and two research papers, the workload is pretty low, which makes it easy to focus on studying the content. The content of the class itself was pretty easy to understand, and each lecture by Professor Horton as well as the slides made the content clear. The study guides were also extremely helpful for studying for each exam.",
                    "26": "Classic psychology lecture, 3 exams that were all very fair in terms of the content learned and 2 research reports which were 1 page summaries of an article you pick (basically a grade boost if you put a little work into them).",
                    "27": "Prof Horton was definitely a nice professor to work with. He is really organized, passionate about the course materials, and is supportive as well. However, sometimes lectures might feel a bit dull— there are just too many stuff to go over so theres no much time left for interesting activities and stuff. But in general, it is a decent intro–level course for psych majors.",
                    "28": "This course is pretty interesting. Class slides can get confusing sometimes, so I found it best to review throughout the course instead of just close to exams. There are 3 midterms, no final.",
                    "29": "Professor Horton is a great lecturer, and he made the sometimes challenging material (for me, the more neuroscience/cognitive science parts) easier to understand, and more interesting. He is always organized and leaves plenty of time for questions, so it is easy to ask him questions. <br>I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested.",
                    "30": "The content of this class seems really daunting when you're taking it, but I realized I knew more than I thought I did when studying for the exams.  The lectures felt a little disorganized, like jumping from topic to topic without clear links between them, but study guides were provided before each exam that really helped with preparing.   Overall not too hard if you take notes in lecture and do the study guide.",
                    "31": "Three non–cumulative midterms (3x28%) and two research reports (2x7.5%). Research reports were very easy––one page papers summarizing a scientific article. Overall I really like the assignment structure––research reports make you engage with real research but aren't overbearing.<br><br>This class was okay. Sid is nice, but the class itself was rough at points. There's a ton of content and it's not particularly engaging. If this class had met for 50 min three times a week, I think it would have been significantly better. 80 minutes was just too long to sit in a classroom learning introductory cognitive psych.  Overall, easy to get an A if you  go to lecture or read the textbook (one or the other is fine) and actually put in time and effort study. <br><br>Tests were somewhat intense and extended responses were tricky (typically requiring you to remember studies that had been used to prove certain hypotheses, though it wasn't expressly made clear that you need to memorize studies), but if you study you'll be fine. Everything you need to know is taught during lecture and the problems were super fair. It's just a lot of content. If you show up for these tests unprepared, you're in for a world of hurt.<br><br>Only other thing––Sid gets really quiet toward the end of most sentences. He wore a microphone most of the quarter but it wasn't connected to any speaker/amplifier and lectures weren't recorded so I don't know why he as wearing it. Would have been nice if it were on so we could hear him as his voice got quiet. Maybe just sit up front.",
                    "32": "It was good overall",
                    "33": "This was a great class! The material was very interesting and Professor Horton did a great job of lecturing. I wouldn't say the exams themselves are easy, but the lectures and powerpoints are really effective at helping you remember the content.",
                    "34": "The class (and professor) is pretty straightforward, so it wasn't as bad as I was expecting! Two research reports (one page review of a study) and 3 exams (multiple choice + short answer) make up your entire grade.",
                    "35": "pay attention in lectures because there is a decently dense amount of content in each lecture, test questions can be tricky so it's good to study for the tests little by little instead of cramming. overall not too difficult, you just have to pay attention to elcture and study for tests. research reports are fairly simple too",
                    "36": "This course is very content heavy but super interesting. The tests and grading are pretty fair. All of the tests are the same format and non–cumulative, which is nice.",
                    "37": "Overall solid class. Very managable",
                    "38": "This class was pretty good! This class is basically memorization, which I believe is on par with most of the psych classes at NU. Horton was pretty interesting and he used a lot of examples and stuff from past research to engage the class. If you want to do well, you'll likely need to review the content at least weekly/a couple days before exams. The class was 3 exams worth 100 points each and two small research report summaries worth 25 points each. Not hard by most means, you just need to study.",
                    "39": "As a person who loves psychology, this course was fantastic. Sid seems to really like psychology. There was only 2 hw assignments per quarter (excluding the book readings which I never did and aren't necessary if you attend lecture) which were very manageable.",
                    "40": "It's a fine course, but it's so dense. It can be a bit monotonous at times, but as long as you spend a solid chunk of time grinding flashcards on every piece of the study guide material you should be okay. You do not have to read the textbook.",
                    "41": "I thought the class was pretty good, but not necessarily a walk in the park. If you go to lectures, review the study guides, and pay attention, you should be fine. Reading the textbook is not necessarily required, as everything is covered in the slides. I liked how if we didn't get to slides in class, then we wouldn't be tested on it. Professor Horton is super nice, very understanding, and flexible, and I appreciated the effort and enthusiasm he put into teaching. Be sure to take notes, as it can be hard to remember what the prof was trying to convey on each slide, and every slide is necessary to know because it could be on the test. The lectures can be a little long sometimes and hard to get through, but no major complaints from me.",
                    "42": "The material was good, work load was manageable and lectures not too dry.",
                    "43": "Great column B class for the psych major/minor. Easy A if you put in the work and can memorize well. Some of the topics we learned about were perception, selective attention, short–term and long–term memory, language, problem–solving, and decision making.<br><br>I found Prof Horton’s lectures to be a bit dense and fast–paced (and they’re not recorded), but regardless it was very cool to find out the ways people think and learn! To keep up with lectures, I skimmed the textbook sections before class, and that did the trick.<br><br>There are 3 non–cumulative exams, tested on about 5–6 lectures each. They consisted of 32 MC and 6 FRQs. A study guide was given before each exam, which was helpful in summarizing the topics that will be tested on. Exams were very straightforward and grading was fair, but make sure to budget your time accordingly since you only get 80 minutes (the class period) to do them.<br><br>There was no homework other than two short 1–page single–spaced research reports, where you choose a scientific journal article and summarize it. Grading is lenient for these as long as you follow the directions.<br><br>As for grading, the class is 350 points total. Each exam is worth 100 points, and each research report is 25 points. 92.5% is an A. <br><br>The entire class is done before Thanksgiving break, so that’s a plus.",
                    "44": "This course was great! Lecture slides covered all the necessary info and the study guides were super helpful for the exams. Loved the format of the class with 3 exams and 2 papers — really light workload. Lectures were long but Prof Horton did a good job to make it engaging.",
                    "45": "Definitely take this course! Professor Horton did a wonderful job with keeping the lectures engaging and interesting. I felt that I learned a lot after each lecture! There are 3 exams and 2 short research papers, which in my opinion were straightforward as long as you studied/followed rubric requirements. Since there are no additional assignments, there is not much you have to do outside of class other than reading the textbook (which align with lectures). Overall, this is a great course and you will pretty much get out what you put in.",
                    "46": "3 non–cumulative exams with ~30 mc and 6 frqs. also 2 1–page discussions about a research paper were graded pretty easily. Lectures could get a little tedious but the content was interesting. Exams were only about the content, so if you are able to memorize the 6 lectures of info, they were pretty easy.",
                    "47": "Prof Horton is super underrated! Love him so much, he is so sweet. The lectures could be a little dry towards the end but I think that's because they are all loaded with content and are 1.20 hrs so it gets a little tiring to focus. Very interesting content and you can easily get an A as long as u a take a few days to study for the exams (they were generous with grading). Would recommend 100%. Don't let the name scare you.",
                    "48": "I found this course very well–organized and put together, as well as being considerate of the student with the assignments, so I appreciate that. I enjoyed going to the lectures, and sometimes did struggle to understand some more complex topics but the professor was always open to answering questions.",
                    "49": "I enjoyed the subjects",
                    "50": "The class has a very strict structure. 2 papers and 3 exams.  The course is interesting but might be a little boring as the course is the same every week"

Prof Rapp is incredibly engaging and explains things clearly. However, the exams are difficult and I found I had to put in 10+ hours of studying for each to get a good grade. They really require you to memorize basically everything he mentions in class. I would still recommend as long as you're prepared for three exams that are difficult.",

His slides don't have much on them though, so you have to go to class and pay attention, but his lectures are very memorable. Super easy class, doesn't take long to study for exams, and the exams are very straightforward. Nothing surprising on the exams, just make sure to write down what he says in class and learn that for the exam. No need to read the textbook. Though I enjoyed the lectures because they were engaging, the material could be quite boring. other than 3 non–cumulative midterms, there are 2 writing assignments which are helpful to develop the skill of reading and actually understanding psych journals, and are graded very fairly, just listen and do what he says to do on them, and you will get 100",

                    "11": "Really interesting and information–packed class. Professor Rapp is great at explaining complicated concepts. Grading on short–answer portions of midterm was stingy.",
                    "12": "This was an amazing course and I learned so much. It was very well structured and Professor Rapp was amazing. Definitely take this course for Column B, or if you are interest in cog psych at all!",
                    "13": "The \"study guide\" for the exams was not very helpful and we could have used clearer expectations. Lectures were engaging though.",
                    "14": "This course is definitely tougher than I had anticipated. Prof. Rapp is a good lecturer, but make sure you pay attention and attend lectures as that is important to do well on the exams.",
                    "15": "I took this class because the previous CTECs looked good, and that really wasn't my experience. It is pretty aggressive for a psych class, and was kind of a bummer to have to sit through 3 hours of lecture a week (which you had to attend because most important info was conveyed by the prof speaking) about material that was eh. The essays are pretty chill, but the exams are graded SUPER harshly, especially the written parts and its really hard to even try to get points back. Overall, would not recommend unless you are very interested in the subject.",
                    "16": "This was a great class especially with Rapp. The lectures and always engaging and Rapp makes class fun.

I enjoyed it with prof rapp. at first it was hard to get used to and something about his lecture style was overwhelming and hard to follow. you really have to write down a lot of what he says and def have to go to class because his slides are not self explanatory at all. sometimes they are just one word or picture lol. but if you go to class you'll be good! the content is super interesting even though i wasn't interested in cog psych going into the class. a lot of cool studies. we have 3 midterms and 2 1 page research reports where you summarize an article. those research reports really help your grade and you can def get a 100. the first midterm was harder for me but got better as we went. multiple choice and short answers. he is not trying to trick you at all and id say the midterms are very reasonable. he gives you a list of topics as a review which is nice to lay out your studying. honestly just use the readings if you are confused about something or there is a topic on the review not in your notes. otherwise don't waste your time, better to just review your notes. the only thing i'll say is this class can be hard with the sheer amount of studies we learn about. its hard to keep track of all of them and what they relate to and sometimes the short answers will ask you about a certain study that supports a certain idea and you have to rack your brain for the right one. try explaining the studies to someone else if you are having a hard time. overall great experience in this class!",
                    "20": "Taking Cog Psych with Rapp was BY FAR the best decision I ever made. He is such a fun professor and does a good job at making the lectures engaging, especially when including interactive elements in the class. Rapp is also so approachable and one of the easiest professors to talk to about course questions and research. This class definitely made me more interested in cognitive psych (even though it's one of the dreaded Column B major requirements), and I can't think of a better professor to have taught the course!",
                    "21": "Course content was relatively straightforward, with a concept typically introduced with an experiment + the difficulties/problems with our current understanding of the concept. Exams mostly covered lectures, but the textbook definitely has useful supplementary details/definitions. I didn't really like the article summary assignments since they were only 1–pg in length / double–spaced, but also mostly because they didn't really feel like I was doing anything with the concepts from the course. Prof. Rapp is also a very enthusiastic lecturer, so you will be engaged with his energy + in–class experiments.",
                    "22": "The slides felt lacking and unrepresentative of the lecture. I found it hard to review when there's no lecture recordings and the slides are lacking.",
                    "23": "I was not interested in the subject before taking it but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the class. Prof Rapp is an amazing lecturer and communicates all lecture material very clearly. There are 3 exams and 2 research reports, each being 1 page double spaced. It is not time consuming and he gives you a study guide for the exams that are extremely helpful. Take this class with Prof Rapp!",
                    "24": "A totally passable class. Took for a distro after having taken AP Psych. Felt like I already knew a lot of the material, but I didn't think it was a waste of time, some interesting topics. You can definitely take and do fine in this course, grade–wise.",
                    "25": "Professor Rapp is the best! I was not excited for this class because cognition is my least favorite part of psychology, but he made it not just bearable, but interesting. Professor Rapp is funny, engaging, and insightful. The textbook is useless; just go to lecture and you will get all the information you need for exams. Exams take a lot of memorization but if you memorize the necessary terms, you'll do very well, no worries. You NEED to go to lecture though because the slides have basically nothing on them, and Professor Rapp says everything you need to know.",
                    "26": "The lectures were interesting!",
                    "27": "I would recommend taking this class even if you are not a psychology major, as this course gives insight into learning and memory, and knowing how these two things work is exteremely helpful for a college student. Additionally, Prof. Rapp is a great lecturer.",
                    "28": "I took this class because I needed a psych course for my major. The grade is made up of 3 exams and 2 research reports. The exams are kind of difficult mostly because of the short answer questions, which are long and graded hard. Overall, Rapp is a really engaging lecturer, so he makes the content interesting. You definitely have to study for the exams to do well, so I wouldn't say this class is an easy A or A–. It really depends on how much effort you put into studying. If you have to take this course, take it with Rapp",
                    "29": "Take this class! I did not expect to be very interested in the topics, but Rapp is a highly engaging lecturer and presents the topics and relevant literature in a very interesting and clear way. The three non–cumulative exams require a good amount of studying, but they are overall reasonable. Textbook expands on topics and mostly repeats the information, so it can be helpful, but not reading it probably wouldn't hurt your grade too much. Two one–page research reports are graded pretty nicely as long as you follow the guidelines.",
                    "30": "Professor Rapp is an excellent professor, his lectures are so engaging and fun to listen to, and since the content can be applied to your real life experiences almost immediately, it makes memorizing the content more easy. The only grades in the class are 3 exams and two research reports, but the research reports are really straightforward to do (they're limited to one page max each) and the exams are very doable as long as you're able to recall the concepts taught in the lecture and recall what research experiments discussed in lecture support those concepts. Definitely a good class to take for psych majors/minors, and definitely recommend those preparing for the MCAT to take this course as well; a lot of concepts taught in this class I feel is pretty rudimentary for the MCAT psychology/sociology section.",
                    "31": "This course was fantastic! Professor Rapp was super engaging and explained material in a way that really supported students' understanding. 3 noncumulative exams and 2 short papers summarizing recent research in the field.",
                    "32": "Past CTECS are so misleading. This course is not as easy as it is made out to be; the content and material is very interesting, but something about the exam format and the grading harshness made me question why I took this class. Not an easy A at all. 3 exams, 2 research reports that are basically 1 page summarizing journal articles; if you make small mistakes your grade will be really hard to save. I don't even know how I'm doing in the class.",
                    "33": "I loved this course much more than I thought I would coming in! I generally find myself more attracted to the neuroscience side of things, so I was worried about whether or not I would like the conceptual nature of cognitive psychology. However, Professor Rapp is a fantastic lecturer, super fun, and a great person overall. He would always find ways to make us laugh, and engage us in live cognitive psych experiments that helped us to learn and remember the course concepts. He did a fantastic job at building a lexicon to remember things, and using those examples on exams to help us remember information (For example, I still remember Professor Rapp's grocery list in the first 1/3 of the quarter as a way to exemplify maintenence rehearsal and the phonological loop in working memory!). He made the topics engaging, and most importantly, he was dedicated in drawing important links between cognitive psychology and our daily lives, making all of the knowledge we learned in the course feel truly important in understanding the world, even if we did not seek to become cognitive psychologists. Overall, with incredibly engaging and fun lectures and fantastic exam designs, I would highly recommend this course for anyone interested in cognitive psychology, or just learning how our minds work in daily life!",
                    "34": "His slides are not great. I wish he put more effort into them so you can view them and understand, but if you don’t take a bunch of notes in class you won’t know what’s going on in the slides. He is a great teacher. I feel that his tests are trying to trick students sometimes. Some questions just seem very vague and confusing. His essay questions are a lot about experiments we saw in class, but again, so many and the slides don’t help. I would take his class again, but just be aware of this and prepare. During office hours he is very kind and answers questions. I just feel that he tries to trick people with some of the test questions, and that just seems unnecessary.",
                    "35": "I really enjoyed the content of this course! Prof Rapp is great at explaining concepts and provides hilarious examples to help you understand them. He does talk too fast so it can be hard to keep up. Response papers were fine (clear guidelines), but I think the exams were too rough so it's hard to get an A.",
                    "36": "This was a well taught course; however, the exams are very difficult and you will get points off for the most nit–picky details!!",
                    "37": "DMR is awesome. He really makes a subject I was not really interested in, interesting. Tests are fair",
                    "38": "Professor was a complete jerk who made fun of his family and other universities. He is rude and elitist and I know so many people that dropped the class because of his attitude. Not a nice guy and I do not recommend taking this class",
                    "39": "This is a good class. Mostly memorizing and applying for the tests. The research reports are super easy .",
                    "40": "This is a great psych course and not over–the–top challenging. If you are able to take classes with Professor Rapp, you should – he is funny, engaging, and wants you to succeed. Really important that you go to lectures, or you will be lost when it comes time for the exams. You will have to do more than just memorize definitions for the test, but if you understand the material, you will do well. There are 3 non–cumulative exams (although the last is during finals week) and 2 single–page research reports (summarizing research that already exists). Pretty standard psych course. I liked it, and a great Column B class!",
                    "41": "It was a really interesting class, with a lot of pros and cons.  The pros are the professor is a really funny and interesting lecturer that makes the class entertaining, and his lecturing was definitely the best part.  The cons are that the slides are pretty useless to study (they make no sense without the lecture), and the lectures are not recorded, so if you ever need to miss a lecture you're basically screwed for that content if you do not have a friend in the class who can send you notes.  Also, the exams initially seem somewhat tough but fair until you realize how nonsensically the written section is graded.  You could be asked to broadly explain a concept, explain it in a way which is entirely correct, but get points off because you did not use an exact word the TAs/prof were looking for, even if you used five synonyms.  Frankly, I do not know if it falls on the TAs or if its what the professor told them, but the grading just felt very lazy in the way it allowed the graders to avoid judging the essay's quality, and just look at whether or not it had specific word(s) instead.  That aspect was definitely frustrating.  Still, it was interesting and an easy B, so overall it was ok i guess.",
                    "42": "I really liked the material of this class and thought the real–world examples were really cool to learn about. I also love David Rapp! He's super funny and makes jokes about NU basketball and Spiderman. He's clearly very knowledgeable about the subject and cares about his students learning. However, he talks actually AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT and I felt like I missed so much important stuff. His slides have basically no info on them so you can't miss class or anything he says or you will suffer. I also think the exams were not very fair. It seems like the class is set up for the average grade to be a B because of the difficulty of the multiple choice. He says he isn't trying to trick you but he kind of does. Anyways,  take Cog Psych with Rapp but be prepared to work hard definitely not an easy A or even A–."

Also make sure to do textbook readings and try to get 100% on each ZAPS and any “easy” points because the cutoff for an A was a 94 so you need every point you can get. She would also sometimes reuse questions from the practice quizzes in the midterms so those are good to do. Making my own flash cards was also super helpful.",

There's also a lot of readings on top of lecture content for exams. The grading is 70% exams and the rest is pretty easy to do well on. She has 3 midterms and 1 final, but only takes the 3 highest score so you don't have to take the final. She grades the free questions really harshly and if you had only written what she said on the slide it's not enough to get full marks, you have to go to class cause she doesn't record and there's not enough information on her slides. There's extra credit for attending lecture.",
                    "5": "This was a very enjoyable psych course – I took this for a major req but I imagine that this would be a very enjoyable distro as well. Prof Broaders makes coming to class worthwhile and enjoyable, and the exams are not bad – they are non–cumulative, and if you do well on the 3 midterms you don't have to take the final.",
                    "6": "I really liked Professor Broader's lecture style –– she was funny, engaging, and taught interesting topics. She also gave you extra credit often times just for coming to class. That said, the tests were more difficult than they had to be, and there were four of them, including one cumulative final –– you had to keep constantly checking the syllabus for when the next one was, because as soon as you were done with one, you very quickly had an upcoming exam. You had to really know the material and study a lot to do well on the tests (which was a combination of multiple choice and free response). The multiple choice part asked you to recall minute details from lectures, chapters, and videos, and you had apply the knowledge to answer difficult questions. For the free response portion, points were taken off for things that didn't seem fair –– you could know the material backwards and forwards but still have trivial things wrong with your answer than can dock a lot of points. You were expected to do significant amounts of reading for each lecture, and, along with the main textbook, you were also required to read a supplemental text called \"Make It Stick\" that teaches you how to study more effectively, and write a paper on it. Overall, I did learn a lot in this class, but it's definitely not an easy A, and I found some of the grading methods questionable.",

I enjoyed the subject and feel that lecture was pretty engaging; there are a lot of demos sprinkled in throughout and they demonstrate the course concepts well. The readings weren't too bad, but they are a requirement if you want to do well on exams as some content in the textbook is not presented. The exams themselves were pretty in line with what was taught with MCQs and a few FRQs. There was also one paper based on the content from Make it Stick – not too hard or painful to write. She also gives plenty of opportunities for extra credit and provides a generous curve.",

                    "11": "I'm interested in cognitive psychology, and you definitely learn a lot from this course. However, I would say this is not a workload–light class at all and wouldn't take it for a distro. Exams (3 out of 4, so you can drop one exam) are 72%, practice quizzes on canvas are 8% (MCQ based on the textbook, marked on completion but completion in this context means 80% or above.... so my final grade in this class is 3% lower than what it could've been 🥲), zaps labs are 10% (you have to pay at least $25 to access this online resource, which I highly disliked, but they were quite easy), and a paper on how to prepare for an exam is 10% (I think this was graded quite harshly, and because our grades were returned during reading week there was LITERALLY no time to go to the TA's office hours and get more detailed feedback). This is not a class where you can maybe skip the readings, you need to do them because the MCQ are based on them + the paper you write is entirely based off a textbook 'Make it stick'. However, the textbooks' contents overlap A LOT and it can be very very tiring/boring to complete the readings. An A in this class is a 94.00, which has caused me a lot of unnecessary headaches because if it was a 93.00 like the rest of the classes in Weinberg I would easily be in the clear. There are a lot of opportunities for extra credit (maybe +0.5% every week) if you show up, and that's how she rewards attendance, but I think I would prefer a lower grade threshold and less reading to extra credit opportunities. <br><br>(Also, if you've taken Ling 250 and 260, that gets really helpful for the lecture on morphology and phonology towards the end of the quarter!)",

That said, the slides don't contain all the material covered in class and there aren't class recordings, and reading the textbook is necessary to do well in the class. For some reason, this psych class seemed slightly harder than other psych classes I've taken, but I think that's just because the subject wasn't as interesting to me, but overall good course and the teacher's very nice. There is one paper due but it's very manageable.  And you get a good amount of points just for homework which is nice. And there's an optional final that can replace one of your midterm grades.",

Lots of textbook reading that you NEED to read because she does not cover everything in lecture. Also know you basically have to attend lecture because they are not recorded and her posted slides are just bullet points that give little detail into what u have to know. But not too hard of a class. A bit hard to get an A but put in effort and you will definetly get at least a B+ or A–",

She is so engaging and passionate and made me want to go to class so I could listen to what she has to say. Even though I struggled a lot through the quarter with the material, I don't regret taking this course as I loved the lectures and found it to be so rewarding overall. Definitely take a class with Broaders if you haven't already!",

I actually didn't do any of the assigned readings, but I made sure to do the practice quizzes plenty of times, and I was still able to finish with an A in the class.

I wish there was less content based on the textbook and sometimes the lectures were a little unfocused but overall a very clear and organized class.",
                    "21": "This is an amazing course!! Especially because it is taught by Broaders who in my opinion is one of the best psych professors here. She makes lectures so interesting and fun and also gives out so much extra credit it's awesome. My advice for anyone taking this course is to GO TO LECTURES!!! Not only are they just incredibly fun and interesting, but you also get extra credit just by being there and participating. There are some out–of–class assignments but they only take about 20 minutes to complete and are generally pretty interesting and fun. There is one essay on Make It Stick which is a reading you'll be assigned to do, it was also pretty chill and kind of a fun essay to write. There are I think 4 total exams, but only 3 of them stay in the grade book the lowest score is dropped. So you don't have to take the final if you're ok with your grade before it which is so nice. The exams are all pretty fair, oftentimes Broaders will mention in class what the short answer questions will be  (another reason to go to class). I loved this class it was awesome !!!",

The lectures are incredibly dense and I found it very difficult to pay attention for the full class time, which is necessary if you want to do well in this class. Professor Broaders is also oddly passive–aggressive and makes comments about students performance during class that rubbed me the wrong way. If you are willing to attend class 100% of the time and be actively engaged and taking consistently good notes throughout class you will do well, but if that seems unrealistic for you this class probably won't be a good fit.",
                    "24": "As expected, a LOT of material but always interesting.  Broaders tries her best to make every lecture engaging, but the amount of material stuffed into every class makes it hard sometimes. Exams include free response and are generally really difficult, you can’t slack a day or you WILL fall behind; her policies are not forgiving.  Take it if this will be your most time–consuming class.",
                    "25": "To be honest I didn't really have a reason for taking this course, it didn't count towards anything and I was just interested in seeing if I wanted to keep taking more psych classes here at Northwestern. I don't think taking cognitive psychology was the best choice just because like 75% of the people who took it had to for their cognitive psychology or neuroscience majors and there was a TON of content focused on all different parts of cognitive psychology. Overall, I think if you're good at memorizing then an A is achievable but I've heard that compared to other psychology classes this one is a lot more work (ZAPs assignments, textbook reading, book reading, a 5–page paper, and the exams) so just keep that in mind.",
                    "26": "This class was challenging, dense and utterly fascinating. The lectures were fast–paced, covered swaths of material at varying degrees of complexity and yet still we were expected to absorb even more material through the textbook, which included dozens of concepts not covered in class. I learned a substantial amount about cognitive psychology and left more excited than ever to learn more, however, I do wish this course had been more focused or that the textbook and lectures had atleast a bit more overlap. If you are interested in learning a great deal about the underlying concepts behind how we think, perceive, learn and remember I would still easily recommend this course, just be prepared to study consistently, take good notes and follow along with the textbook critically.",
                    "27": "Tests and homework assignments were not particularly difficult and it is well defined on how to do well in this class. I found the amount of homework and the length of the exams to be a little much. Prof goes through the notes really fast but does a good job of explaining everything",
                    "28": "This is a really interesting course. The instruction is really interesting and engaging.  The exams can be hard given that there is a lot of content and the class is not recorded, the slides also do not have a lot of information on them and can be hard to follow if you do not attend class. Professor Broaders provides flash cards, practice quizzes, zaps assignments, and textbook readings for the class. The exams are also curved. If you go to class and regularly engage with the content, this class is manageable to pass.",
                    "29": "I think that anyone who is interested in going into a social science–related field (e.g., law, consulting, policy, research, etc), regardless of major, should take this class. Going into it I wasn't too excited about cognitive psych, but it definitely exceeded my expectations. Broaders is a great lecturer and I genuinely learned so much about how people think, remember, mentally organize things, and make judgments. the work load isn't too bad, you do have to do the readings but as long as you stay on top of it it's manageable. there are 3 midterms and a final, but your lowest exam grade is dropped so if you're happy with your grade after the last midterm you don't have to take the final. the exams are fair, and often times questions that were on the canvas practice tests (that you're required to complete) were also on the exam. there's also one paper but it's pretty chill. we even got extra credit just for coming to class most of the time. I would definitely recommend taking this class, especially if you're a psych major looking to go into a social sciences field that needs a column B class, but also for anyone who is curious about mental processes and how they shape human behavior.",

                    "31": "Prof. Broaders is an amazing lecturer and during most of the lectures I would be glued to everything being said, totally emerged in the material. The 3 midterm exams are not easy but are okay if you 1) – go to lectures, 2) – take good notes. 3) – complete the readings and the quizzes during the week.  Great class and great introduction to cognitive psychology.",
                    "32": "This course was good. Professor Broaders was very passionate about the topic and always presented it in an interactive and fun manner. The exams were pretty hard but she provided us with a lot of extra credit opportunities.",
                    "33": "Don't take this class unless you have to, I don't feel like I really learned that much and it was pretty boring for me.",
                    "34": "I found this class to be quite difficult due to the sheer amount of content that needs to be reviewed for each midterm. With each lecture, there usually was a chapter worth of material from the textbook that also needs to be read, which can get pretty tedious to keep up with later on in the quarter. The course consisted of 3 midterms, an optional final, and an essay. The midterms consisted of MCQ + FRQ, and the optional final was all multiple choice. The FRQs were graded quite harshly since you would usually have points deducted for not giving the exact textbook definition for a term. However, Professor Broaders gives out a lot of extra credit from lectures which help out a TON in terms of keeping your grade up. Professor Broaders is an amazing lecturer, and I always found her classes to be very engaging!",
                    "35": "This course was super interesting and pretty low stress. Professor Broaders is an excellent lecturer and clearly articulates topics and ideas in an interesting and insightful way! She also offers a generous amount of extra credit which encourages students to attend class and definitely adds a little extra cushion to your grade in the class.",
                    "36": "If you're interested in psych you'll probably get a lot out of this course. I was afraid it would just be a repetition of things I've already learned but Prof. Broaders does in depth in a way that is super interesting but also not overwhelming. I'm not usually one to read the textbook but this one was actually really interesting and really did help with reinforcing the class materials and building off of them. Prof. Broaders wants you to do well, so if you put in the work I think it's a fairly easy class.",
                    "37": "Overall not a difficult class. Not much work on a day–to–day basis, just remember to do the 10–minute Zaps labs by the night before class. I find it helpful to do the textbook readings before the exam as the main studying method. Pay close attention on the practice quizzes, since she reuses a lot of the questions on the exam",
                    "38": "Professor Broaders is a great lecturer! I didn't enjoy the content of this class as much as other psych classes, but it's a great Column B option, and you learn a lot!",
                    "39": "More work than you'd think, but is skewed (curves are good) because it is full of freshmen. Professor Broaders is great since she is a teaching professor, but her lectures get lengthy and boring due to the subject matter.",
                    "40": "I would highly recommend for the Group A elective for neuroscience. The content is pretty intuitive and the class format of having an optional final offers cushion. I don't think that any of the content is particularly difficult and it's all pretty interesting.",
                    "41": "I wasn't interested in Cog Psych to begin with, left the course being very strongly against taking another psych course ever in the future. Super boring.",
                    "42": "Tips: do the practice tests!! <br><br>Our section had 4 tests, one of which was dropped. Tests are short answer and mcq. There is also 1 mid quarter essay on the “make it stick” learning strategy book. This was easy but not that fun. The class had very interesting material and the professor has lots of in class demonstrations of cognitive concepts. Good class for an intro to cog sci (which it better be)",
                    "43": "The exams were definitely challenging, especially because there were about 50 multiple questions to complete and then about two or three short answer questions to complete, and the short answer questions often had multiple parts. So, timing was definitely hard. For this class, you definitely need to spend time reading the textbook and doing the practice quizzes, and taking detailed lecture notes.",
                    "44": "I would recommend this course! People had told me it was the hardest psych class at NU, but it was not bad! Of course, you need to study a lot to do well on the exams, but everything was pretty straightforward. The textbook readings were a bit dull at times, but the ZAPS and lectures were engaging.",
                    "45": "This is a great Group A class for the neuroscience major and is super interesting. I attended lectures (there is often extra credit given out for attending), studied with flashcards for the exams, and was able to do well in the course. The content is super interesting, and Professor Broaders does a fantastic job of presenting the content in an interesting way. There are ZAPS labs for homework which are an easy way to get points as well as a way to see the concepts in real–world applications. The free response on exams are graded strictly, so be sure to define terms thoroughly and be very specific in your answers. The content for the free response was never really a surprise based on what we focused on in class. I would recommend reading the textbook for exams, as there are some things that she doesn't discuss in class. Overall, I thought the class was very interesting and made me want to take more psych classes!",

                    "47": "This class was really interesting! Broaders lets you drop your lowest exam grade (3 midterms + a final), so if you have an A before the final, you don't have to take it. Exams cover A LOT of content, though, so make sure you start studying early. Broaders gives you practice quizzes for each textbook chapter and the multiple–choice portions of the midterms are like 90% the same. I really wish the lectures were recorded, though, because she talks so fast in lecture that it's hard to keep up, and some of what she says isn't in the textbook.",
                    "48": "The course requires you to attend lectures (they are non–recorded), read the textbook (which covers content not covered in class), and read a second book (which you will write a paper on). It is undeniable I learned a lot throughout the course; however, the readings take up a significant potion of your time. The exam has many questions, which make it feel rushed to finish on time. The exam's however aren't too bad, but the TA's love taking points off for not elaborating enough in the free responses, so make sure you write through definitions.",
                    "49": "The class was fair but tests were difficult",
                    "50": "As a neuro major, this class isn’t bad for fulfilling a Group A elective (below 300 level). There are three non cumulative midterms and one cumulative optional final. She takes the best 3 out of the 4 scores, so if you do well enough on the midterms, you don’t have to take the final. I really recommend trying not to take the final, because the midterms are very doable in terms of studying. The midterms have about 50 MCQ and 2–3 FRQ questions. She will sometimes hint at what she likes to put on the FRQ, so make sure you go to class!! There is one paper worth about 10% of your grade based on a book you will read throughout the quarter about how to study effectively. It’s due around week 7–8 and it’s 4–5 double spaced pages basically explaining the book and its concepts to a college freshman who wants to know how to study effectively. It’s not hard, just a little time consuming. I highly recommend reading the book as you go, instead of leaving all 6 chapters until you want to start writing.<br><br>The only real problem I ran into with this class was the sheer amount of material there was to learn. The lectures, combined with the assigned readings, left me with probably 200 pages of notes all together. Broaders will emphasize on the first day that you need to do the readings, and she’s (mostly) right. The lectures will often emphasize things the book did not, and vice versa. You will be expected to read entire chapters (~ 40 pgs) before class. If not, you’ll just have to catch up later. I took notes on the readings, which is why I was left with so many notes. You can probably get by without doing detailed notes like I did, but as someone who didn’t have to take the final, I accredit that to doing the readings throughout the quarter and paying attention in lecture. <br><br>As far as assignments go, there are practice quizzes on Canvas for every chapter you read from the book (25 question) that you only need to complete to 80% in order to get full points for the assignment. Do these quizzes early and often!!! They are REALLY helpful in studying for the multiple choice questions on midterms (the exact questions sometimes show up). There are also short, interactive labs that you’ll do that are done through the online version of the book you will need to buy. They are super easy and take 10 minutes tops. Finally, she often gives extra credit just for showing up to class, whether it be for a survey of some sort or for doing an activity in class. I recommend showing up to every class (like literally every single one). If you noticed, there’s no incentive to do the readings, other than that it will help you in recall when it comes time to study if you’ve already read it and taken notes on it.<br><br>Broaders is a fun lecturer, and pretty engaging, but you really need to go to class and listen, because her notes that she posts after class are not at all helpful. They’re basically just bullet points for HER, not for you. You won’t get any of the important examples or details if you simply write down what’s on the slides after class. On top of that, she does talk quite fast and tends to speed by a lot of slides, so you have to write down what you think is most important (write down the examples and anything that isn’t on the slides!) <br><br>Overall, this class is NOT hard because of the material– in fact, most of the material is really interesting and applicable to things you do every day without realizing. You’ll learn about memory, language, cognition, etc– all about how your mind works, not so much the brain. However, the class is difficult because of the AMOUNT of information there is. It can get very time consuming, especially with the readings. I really (REALLY) recommend trying to stay on top of the readings as best you can, doing the practice quizzes after you’ve done the reading for the chapter and finished that module in lecture, and then redoing the quizzes a bunch as a way to study for the midterm. The quizzes change questions every time, and you can do them as many times as you want. And, make sure you go to class and participate in any and every activity to get all the extra credit you can!!",
                    "51": "Do the practice quizzes; they will help you so much on the midterms. If you do the work, the class honestly isn't that bad. As long as you go to lecture and take notes on the textbook, you will do well. Also, Broaders always gives out EC in lectures and is honestly just an engaging teacher.",
                    "52": "I really enjoyed this course, and if you are interested in learning about cognition, memory, etc, it's definitely a super fun class. We learned quite a lot and the textbook was very interesting to read. Lectures are good too and they have a lot of bonus content/opportunities for extra credit so definitely show up to them. Professor Broaders is a great lecturer and makes class very interesting. The exams are somewhat difficult but if you actually read the textbook getting an A is not hard."

                    "1": "Content is pretty interesting but this is not a well taught course. Grading for homework feels super arbitrary and they couldn’t really explain why I got the grade I got. Office hours were often cancelled or you’d show up and nobody would be there. When you went there were less helpful than other classes and would not give feedback on your ideas. There is no real schedule and you randomly find out dates of quizzes which you do get 5 days to do. I don’t know why we can’t get a full schedule in advance like we do for every other class. Quizzes were super detailed and specific and required intense reading and notes for each chapter. Questions were poorly written and at least the practice questions were from Quizlet and often unclear. It felt unreasonable to need to set up with lockdown browser and a webcam for these little quizzes. I would’ve preferred midterms or taking quizzes in class honestly. I did appreciate that we got exam questions in advance and that we got to vote to narrow them down. But overall I would not take this class if you don’t have to. I’ve taken many harder psych classes and will probably get a worse grade in this one because of how the class is evaluated.",
                    "2": "Developmental psych is one of the most interesting classes you can take at Northwestern. The content is really relevant to real life and the class lectures are very engaging!",

                    "4": "Overall I enjoyed this class. The prof is pretty good at lecturing (and she gives you extra credit for showing up to lectures almost every class). The topics were pretty interesting and the prof uses a lot of examples that really help you remember the concepts. She makes everyone with a laptop sit in a designated section of the room, and (as someone who doesn't use a laptop) I really liked this. The homework is your choice of 3 out of 6 short essays. I got these out of the way fairly early in the quarter, so it wasn't too bad. Other than that, most of your grade comes from Canvas (Lockdown Browser) quizzes that you take on your own after she finishes lecturing on each topic.",
                    "5": "this class was a lot of work (10 quizzes and drop one, 3 papers, and a final with long answer qs) but so worth it if you're interested in the material. broaders is super helpful in office hours and gives a lot of extra credit if you go to class",
                    "6": "Broaders is a great lecturer. Readings felt kind of long and I personally ended up taking too many notes because we didn’t have a study guide and I wasn’t sure what would be on quizzes. Doing the readings is also helpful for writing essays. Sometimes the quiz questions felt overly specific but if you do readings, go to class (which also gets you a lot of extra credit points) then you will be okay. I would recommend doing the practice quizzes more than once because some of the questions will appear on the actual quizzes.",
                    "7": "The course overall was really interesting, and I loved the different video clips we watched during class. There was an extra credit activity for basically every lecture that would count toward our formal quiz grade, so that was definitely nice. The formal quizzes themselves were not that difficult if you read the textbook and went to the lectures, and you kind of have to go to lectures since they aren't recorded. The homework assignments were sometimes graded pretty strict, but that might be more dependent on who your assigned TA is.",
                    "8": "The content of the course was fine, but its structure was not. The module quizzes were honestly the worst part about the course. The lack of due dates made it very difficult to anticipate one's workflow and plan for it because the quizzes only became active after Prof. Broaders finished teaching that module. We had weeks where we didn't have any module quizzes and weeks where we had three (despite there being 10 quizzes that would align easily with the 10 weeks in the quarter). Honestly, it felt like the instructor struggled to keep to a schedule that got pushed onto students in the class. The questions on the quizzes were very convoluted and often about very insignificant points mentioned in the textbook. The point of them was to check if you read carefully enough to remember every possible detail about the textbook, not if you actually understood the material, which felt pretty detrimental to long–term retention and actual learning. Would've preferred scheduled midterm exams, which would've made it easier to plan and study for over the quarter. Questions on module quizzes rarely reflected the class (entirely about readings), and readings were much better at explaining concepts than lectures. So really, the only point of attending class was to get extra credit points (which was nice and honestly a big help). Speed of grading also could be improved for homework, having ungraded assignments on the day of the final is not great. Overall, I wasn't a fan, but it was doable if you had to. But really, there are better courses out there",
                    "9": "A LOT of work. However, great instructor and you will learn about child development more than ever before. I actually loved going to lectures.",
                    "10": "This class is way more time consuming and difficult than it should be. Broaders just made assignments and essay prompts more complicated than they should have been. The quizzes were so tedious, especially because there were so many and they were pretty in depth from the chapter (which was long and hard to memorize). It sometimes felt that she didn’t respect our time because of how often the quizzes and essay–type homeworks were.",
                    "11": "Professor Broaders isn't the most engaging but that doesn't mean she's bad at all. She knows what she's talking about and gives extra credit in every lecture so you have a little incentive to attend lecture, plus they aren't recorded. Overall, it's not an easy A but it's not a hard class at all, no midterms just lockdown browser quizzes that make up like 40% of your grade.",
                    "12": "Broaders has an inflexibility in the way she teaches large classes that really turns me off from her style.",
                    "13": "hard grading",
                    "14": "While I love that midterms were non–existent, this class is pretty time consuming: 10 quizzes (lockdown browser), 3 essays, and a final exam essay.  If you have a busy schedule, this might not be the best class for you, but otherwise you should know: if you have to choose between reading the textbook and going to class, read the textbook! In my opinion, the amount of work required for this class is excessive, but it isn't particularly difficult work, so take your pick",
                    "15": "This course was so interesting and Professor Broaders is great. This class is not that easy and the workload can be a bit heavy at times but because the content is so interesting it feels pretty manageable.",
                    "16": "This is a really interesting class, and Broaders is an excellent prof. Assuming the course is arranged in the same way, there are no exams, and instead 10 \"formal quizzes\" which you take on a lockdown browser outside of class. You have to memorize a lot of material, but the formal quizzes give you the flexibility to do it on your own time. Lecture is really engaging and the textbook reading are pretty interesting as well. I took this class for a neuro group A requirement, and it is super interesting, but not an easy A (you need to put in work). The only downside is that the formal quizzes mean you spend a lot of time studying and the homeworks are graded super harshly (but you only need to do 3 of them). If you show up to class (Broaders gives extra credit points for just showing up), set aside the time to do the reading and study for the formal quizzes, you will succeed (and learn a bunch along the way!)",
                    "17": "I did enjoy this class and I would recommend attending all classes to not only keep up, but because there are extra credit opportunities and the material is taught in an engaging way in class. However, I do wish the quizzes and homework leaned more on what was taught in class rather than in my opinion inconsequential facts and tidbits from the textbook. Many times, it would feel like nothing I had learned in class could actually help me on assignments which was honestly quite demoralizing. The material taught in class is very interesting though and I did enjoy Professor Broader's instruction.",
                    "18": "I would only take this class if you are required to do so, if  this class is not a requirement and you are interested in psychology for the fun of it  or for a minor I wouldn't take this course.  The structure of this course makes it  almost impossible to succeed. The weekly (sometimes twice a week)  quizzes are worth 40% of your grade which means you are struggling to memorize content rather than learn it. The quizzes also are extremely difficult so I wouldn't expect to do well on them unless you put tons of work into memorization.  The class is lecture heavily and unengaging.  I was more worried about keeping grade up as everything is graded so harshly rather than learning the content.  The grading is extremely harsh with no opportunity for corrections. Our final exam is 4 essay questions  (chosen out of 19 questions)  but we get almost no help or guidance on them. We were incentivized to stay for an extra class during reading week because if we didn't go to that class we wouldn't know the questions the professor was thinking about putting on the final.  This class is incredibly stressful and finicky, they choose specific things to focus on when grading and aren't clear about what they are looking for in an essay. The quizzes are difficult and heavily weighted and overall the whole class feels like you can put in every ounce of effort into it and still struggle immensely.",
                    "19": "I really enjoyed the content of this course and I feel like I learned about a lot of topics and in great depth. However grading of the written homework assignments feels very arbitrary as there is no visible rubric. I also understand wanting to encourage attendance but I wish that lecture slides were either posted beforehand or that the lecture was recorded for viewing afterward for notetaking.",
                    "20": "Probably wouldn’t take this class again if I had the choice, I took this class as an elective and definitely not an easy A. Quizzes were all based on long textbook readings and you really have to know your stuff because questions can be super specific (and they're lockdown browser). Spent too much of my time doing readings and studying for quizzes. She drops your lowest quiz but it doesn’t mean much because they’re like 10 or so quizzes. If you don’t want heavy readings then don’t take this class.",
                    "21": "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!! <br><br>I was told this class was ok in the past, but has gone downhill this year. There is at least a quiz a week. They're lockdown browser and the actual quiz is WAY harder and more niche than the practice ones she posts. It feels like you're being tricked even after studying for hours. You have to write three of the papers out of 8(?) options and they are graded HORRIBLY  by the TAs. Expect to be getting in the 60s–80s on those even if they are well written. The professor is not very engaging and doesn't seem too interested in getting to know  or help students. Honestly this class is a headache and probably will end up being one of the most frustrating I take over my entire NU career :(. The topic could be interesting and I enjoyed the videos, but beyond that was very disappointed. Final is an in class hand–written paper.",
                    "22": "I really enjoyed this course. The way it was structured was unique and relatively stress free, and the content was incredibly interesting.",
                    "23": "It was great!",
                    "24": "This class is definitely difficult. Professor Broaders teaches only about 25% of the material, and the rest of it comes from the textbook/other readings and videos. You NEED to do ALL of this extra reading to do well. There are quizzes at the end of every module (so you end up having them at least once a week or even every few days), and the quizzes ask about a lot of things that come from the textbook, even down to the specific ages/amount of time that EVERYTHING happens, which is extremely hard to keep track of because there is SO MUCH MATERIAL. In addition to the quizzes there are 3 required homework papers, and the TAs are instructed to grade them very harshly, and there is a final in–class essay exam. With that being said the content was interesting, there was just so much of it that that got overshadowed by how overwhelming it was.",
                    "25": "It was important to me that I did learn something I didnt know before, and since I know not much about development psych, it was a lot.",
                    "26": "Professor Broaders is an extremely enthusiastic professor who does an excellent job at getting students interested in the material. That said, this is a very challenging class; it often feels like it is not enough even to attend all lectures and do all of the assigned readings in order to do well. You really, truly have to apply yourself in this one to get an A. It is quite challenging, but also rewarding in the end.",
                    "27": "Great class if you're interested in Psychology. One of the worst classes you could possibly take if you just want to get through a distribution requirement.",
                    "28": "This class is a challenging one, but I really loved it. I was already interested in developmental before taking this class, but I liked it even more after the course. Prof. Broaders expects a lot out of you; you have to complete the readings, attend lecture, and watch videos to succeed on the formal quizzes (what we had instead of midterms). The homework essays definitely depend on your TA; I had a very tough TA, and I did poorly on the first essay. However, after going to office hours and seeing what he expected, I was able to do well on the following ones.",
                    "29": "I would be lying if I said I didn't feel like this class took thirty years off of my life. I dedicated every waking hour trying to stay on top of the readings, practice quizzes, and formal quizzes. Not only is the course overly demanding in that respect, trying to navigate the especially critical grading of the homework (3 3–pg assignments) proved especially difficult. Although I did enjoy not having a midterm and learning such interesting material, I would just be prepared to dedicate a lot of additional time to managing the large amount of work/memorization. Also, the final exam is essay based––flashback to AP exams––so do with that information what you will.",
                    "30": "This class was an insane amount of work for a 200 level course. For each of the 10 modules, there was a 25 question quiz that required you to fully know the lectures and textbook chapter in unbelievable detail. Along with that, there were 3 papers throughout the quarter along with a final. The lectures are well put together with great clips and the prof usually gives extra credit but the workload does not make up for that.",
                    "31": "Really good course but a lot harder than I was expecting. You HAVE to do the readings or else you will do bad, but which pretty annoying when there were 40+ pages of reading per module.",

There are also a ton of extra credit opportunities if you just attend class and watch the videos outside of class if/when she says to. I didn't find the class particularly difficult, and found it pretty easy to get an A. Also, BUY/RENT THE TEXTBOOK. It actually is so helpful and so much of the content is explained really well in it. Furthermore, the questions in the back of the book and the questions in the practice quizzes often ended up on exams, so do a bunch of those.<br>Practice quizzes on Canvas = 7% (you just need to get above an 80% on each one) / complete 4 of the 8 discussion question assignments = 16% / exams = 77%.

In short, useful for MCAT takers, a little bit annoying otherwise.",

There is a large focus on the first few years of development, so if that interests you, I would highly recommend the course as a broad overview of developmental concepts! Plus, developmental psychology is such an important topic to learn about, especially if you want to be a parent later in life. Learning *empirically supported* styles of parenting and how different interactions can affect children's cognitive, social, and emotional health is critical.  Professor Broaders did quite a good job designing a broad overview of developmental techinques and important topics. We unfortunately did not get to the last topic, gender development, in time, since we had run a little bit behind schedule toward the latter half. She encouraged us to handwrite our notes (which I usually do not do), and I believe it yielded some pretty signfiicant results! If you take the class, I recommend trying hand–written notetaking, even if you usually write notes on your laptop. It will feel overwhelming at first, but you learn to engage with the most important parts of the material, and handwriting really does improve academic performance according to research studies. If you do choose to take notes on a laptop, you will sit on one side of the room, as she cited research that shows that sitting next to people who use laptops actually decrease academic performance.  Her use of empirically–backed teaching strategies and classroom management strategies is very cool to see, and I feel like it worked for me! The course has two midterm exams and an optional final exam (drop lowest grade), practice quizzes that you only need to get 80% on to get full credit, and discussion questions (choose 4/6–7).",

Throughout the course you are responsible 4/~9 reading responses that were offered throughout the quarter in which you summarize a given reading/video and offer some relevant discussion questions to the field of developmental psychology.  Additionally, there are 3 exams throughout the quarter, only the highest 2 count, so I didn't end up taking the final which ends up being pretty common after the first 2 midterms; the first two midterms are about 60 multiple choice and ~2/3 Free Response Essay question, only focused on the content covered in each half of the class. The final is over 100 questions all multiple choice, but is a cumulative exam unlike the first two.  There are also practice quizzes for the midterms which each unit of them due the day before the midterm, you only need to complete these to an 80% threshold, but I would recommend doing them more times than is necessary as many exam questions came directly from the quizzes. Overall I would say the most important part of the course is attending and paying attention during lectures, there are plenty of opportunities for extra credit offered in class, so there is extra incentive to go!",
                    "19": "I really liked this class! Definitely go to lectures because you will miss important information if you don't and also there are lots of opportunities to get extra credit if you go. Flexibility with the discussion questions (ie you only have to do 4/8) and exams (do not have to take final if you are happy with you grade after the two midterms) is really helpful.",
                    "20": "S(cience)TEM baddies, you guys know how to study for this class based on your previous ones. Will say a lot of work, just study a few days in advance.",
                    "21": "The instruction of this course was extremely helpful. It was clear that Professor Broaders wants her students to succeed and offers materials in order to do so. The material reviewed in class was really interesting and often correlated with the readings from the textbook, so the lecture truly solidified the information we were learning on our own. The in class instruction was very clear and there were chances to earn extra credit through participation, etc.",
                    "22": "I truly loved this class – it was an in–depth exploration into a fascinating subject for me. I also loved the outside readings and material, and thought the lecture style was very engaging.",
                    "23": "I liked how the grading worked.",
                    "24": "As a neuro major, this class isn’t bad for fulfilling a Group A elective (below 300 level). There are two non cumulative midterms and one cumulative optional final. She takes the best 2 out of the 3 scores, so if you do well enough on the midterms, you don’t have to take the final. I really recommend trying not to take the final, since there is so much information by the end of the quarter. The midterms are hard enough, because you’re basically just splitting the class in half in terms of what’s being tested. The midterms have about 50 MCQ and 2–3 FRQ questions. She will sometimes hint at what she likes to put on the FRQ, so make sure you go to class!!<br><br>The only real problem I ran into with this class was the sheer amount of material there was to learn. The lectures, combined with the assigned readings, left me with probably 250–300 pages of notes all together. Broaders will emphasize on the first day that you need to do the readings, and she’s (mostly) right. The lectures will often emphasize things the book did not, and vice versa. You will be expected to read entire chapters (~ 40 pgs) before class. If not, you’ll just have to catch up later. I took notes on the readings, which is why I was left with so many notes. You can probably get by without doing detailed notes like I did, but as someone who didn’t have to take the final, I accredit that to doing the readings throughout the quarter and paying attention in lecture. <br><br>As far as assignments go, there are practice quizzes on Canvas for every chapter you read from the book (30 questions) that you only need to complete to 80% in order to get full points for the assignment. Do these quizzes early and often!!! They are REALLY helpful in studying for the multiple choice questions on midterms (the exact questions sometimes show up). There are 8 short (1–1.5 pages) discussion papers that you do on additional readings. You basically just read them, summarize them, and ask a few follow up questions in about 1 page. There are 8, but you only have to do 4 of them, and you get to pick which ones you do. I really recommend doing the earlier ones if you can, since the quarter only gets busier as you go along and you won’t want to do any extra reading. Finally, she often gives extra credit just for showing up to class, whether it be for a survey of some sort or for doing an activity in class. I recommend showing up to every class (like literally every single one). If you noticed, there’s no incentive to do the readings, other than that it will help you in recall when it comes time to study if you’ve already read it and taken notes on it.<br><br>Broaders is a fun lecturer, and pretty engaging, but you really need to go to class and listen, because her notes that she posts after class are not at all helpful. They’re basically just bullet points for HER, not for you. You won’t get any of the important examples or details if you simply write down what’s on the slides after class. On top of that, she does talk quite fast and tends to speed by a lot of slides, so you have to write down what you think is most important (write down the examples and anything that isn’t on the slides!) <br><br>Overall, this class is NOT hard because of the material– if you’re at all interested in child development, and I mean development in every aspect: language, social, cognitive, sensory, physical, and emotional learning, you will find this class fascinating. You’ll also learn about all kinds of theories of development (freud, erikson, ainsworth, etc) and all kinds of interesting ways to study child development. Some of the material is very specific, like what ages certain skills or characteristics or traits show up in development, but Broaders and the book will emphasize the more important ones. This class is difficult because of the amount of material, so make sure you do the practice quizzes early and often, do the readings, and pay attention in class. And go to class for that extra credit!!",
                    "25": "As someone who does not have much background in psych, I thought it was a great course and quite manageable. Professor Broaders is a great lecturer, the classes were engaging, and the material was always interesting. The whole course was only four discussion questions throughout the quarter (out of 8 opportunities to do so), two midterms, and an optional final.",
                    "26": "This class is great for anybody looking for an interesting distribution requirement to fill. The class is very much oriented to be you get in what you get out, but ultimately it is very manageable with other classes while also remaining stimulating and interesting.",
                    "27": "I loved this class. The lectures were super interesting, and the tests and assignments were very manageable as long as you show up to class and pay attention. Professor Broaders can come across as a bit intense sometimes, but she's very passionate and very knowledgable. Her lectures are filled with information, but it's always very interesting and usually there are funny baby videos and extra credit opportunities. You're also really set up for success in this class if you just show up and do the work, because there are 4 writing assignments that are really short and easy, and you can do a 5th to drop your lowest score, and there are 2 exams but an optional 3rd if you want to drop your lowest score. The exams are fair, and so is the grading on the written assignments.",
                    "28": "Professor Broaders is a super engaging professor and I would recommend attending an office hours just to chat. Actually reading the textbook was more helpful than class lectures, but the best thing you can do is use the practice quizzes (a ton of times). She is generous with the extra credit in class, which is amazingly helpful. On the downside, textbook readings, discussion questions, and other content to prepare for the course were pretty time–consuming.",
                    "29": "I learned a lot about developmental psych in this course! It's a pretty good class with not much homework, just don't fall behind on lecture and information in general as the whole grade is basically determined by your performance in midterms and final.",
                    "30": "I like that she separated the class by written note takers and computer note takers. It was actually way easier to focus in my section.",
                    "31": "overall its an okay course,  just a lot of lecturing at you with like no room for her to slow down if you need it. best advice is to copy what she says like examples vs typing the slides because that's kind of her structure. this personally was not my favorite teaching style so this class was just not my favorite",
                    "32": "Amazing course– I learned so much. I would say tho– it’s tough to not have any science background and take it (it’s heavy on bio and neuroscience which is very cool but perhaps hard to learn for such a quick turnaround and with very little prior knowledge). I REALLY don’t think this course is for everyone– but as you read this– you can decide if it’s right for you. If you have a busy/stacked quarter or schedule DONT take this class. Dev psych is work, but it’s interesting work. As a neuro major, studies corroborated a lot of what I learned in 206 (systems) which was cool to see. I really enjoyed having Broaders. She’s tough– and makes tough exams– but the key is to take her practice quizzes on canvas so many times that you basically memorize them and also do the practice problems from the textbook at the end of the chapters that were relevant to the readings bc she pulls those questions directly for her exams. I also recommend studying with other people to quiz yourself and eachother. <br><br>It’s not an easy A class– and I think I’ll honestly wind up with an A– cause I’m in biochem rn and would rather not take two final exams in one day– which by the way she lets you drop your worst exam if you take the final– in any case– I feel like not getting the A is not the end of the world for the amount you learn and the interesting content. But if you want – getting the A is totally possible and worth it it just requires drilling questions and making time for this class. If you have any interest in how your brain/emotions/personality came to be the way you are today and you’ve heard of a neuron/how it works, or if you are like I wanna be a good parent one day or if you wanna work with children in any capacity, I highly recommend taking this class.  If you’re premed– take this class. In general, it made me more self–reflective about the ways in which my childhood shaped who I am today.",
                    "33": "the content of this class was really interesting, looking at theories of child development, language, cognition, etc. professor broaders is kind of hard to read and her teaching style is both difficult (when she blows through a large topic with few words on the slides so it is hard to catch) and easy to understand (when several videos and in class examples are given). she’s a big fan of extra credit which is nice but two exams make up 77% of your grade which can be rough."

Class is really fun and engaging, you learn a lot and get to apply a lot of the concepts immediately.

Good course, I would take this for a distro or for the theme for cog sci majors.",

You'd have to put in a lot of time doing \"busy work,\" and it felt like I was back in high school again. I was very attentive in class and never missed a single class but was still confused when completing the assignments sometimes. That being said, I liked that we got to learn Tableau and redesign slides. It's definitely not an easy A, but if you want to learn more about data visualization, this class is probably for you.",

However, this has shaped up to be one of my fav classes. It's all about the art of persuasion and giving presentations in the most compelling way possible. I'm so beyond sure that lessons I learned in this class will be applicable to any career path I choose to pursue. On top of all that the class is so easy. There are various group assignments that don't take up too much time. If you do the work and participate the class is a sure bet. Franconeri is really nice and super intresting, which is esp important in a 3 hour class. Time always flew by...however the 5–8 was kind of annoying....overall worth it though.",

The classes were way too long and dry and attendance is mandatory plus you literally learn nothing. Lots of random busy work which sometimes surprisingly gets a lot actually, most of it is group work and with vague instructions. Grading is all over the place, I still have no idea if I'm getting an A or a B at this point. I wish I never took this class and wasted so much time.",
                    "7": "Take this class with Professor Franconeri!! The material you learn is applicable to most if not all jobs, and I can't sit through a presentation anymore without thinking about the concepts we learned in class.",

Professor Franconeri was really engaging which is, in my opinion, the most important quality in a professor teaching a three hour long night class. The readings were interesting and there were tons of guest lecturers who were all really nice and had interesting perspectives on the material being taught and how it related to their life.  One thing to note is that most of the work is group work,  so while I did find all of the assignments useful to my understanding, what you're able to gain from them is somewhat dependent on who you're assigned to work with. Also all of the deadlines are at 5 pm the day before class and I got tripped up by that a few times.",

The 3hr class time was a little crazy but it wasn't my first 3hr class and it sadly won't be my last so don't let that stop you from taking this course. There are informative guest speakers and tutorials on Excel and Tableau that will serve you later in life. Prof Franconeri is also very engaging and kind. My only complaint is that the pop quizzes felt like they were loosely based on the actual content of the readings. We got a lot of questions pertaining to the graphics on the readings or the opinions of the author more than what was actually written in the text. Otherwise, great class! As a super super busy engineering major I found this class to be light comparatively, and it can count toward your theme!",
                    "16": "This class was overall really entertaining. Professor Franconeri’s enthusiasm always made the 3 hour evening class feel like it was only one hour long! He teaches so many valuable things about data visualization and also hands out notes and posts lecture slides so you don’t need to take notes in class.  Make sure to do the weekly readings as there are a few pop quizzes. There are also quite a few mini assignments for this class. Some of them are group work so make sure to plan ahead with your group. Grading can be a little harsh for assignments thet are graded in comparison to your peers, but overall is fair. Participation is also a big part of the grade, but as long as you’re there for attendance every class, you should be fine. Altogether though, a great class for people who will need to make presentations in the future. Seems pretty applicable to business and research.",

Some of the projects do take a little time and brainstorming, but the first half of the quarter is really fun and chill. The grading is a bit harsh, in the way that you almost never get 100% on the assignments, but you usually won't do too bad either.

Even though it was 3 hours, it was super engaging, the content was super applicable to any field you'll go into, and the textbook &amp; materials used to teach were super good. Apart from teaching you how to be a better graphic designer, this class teaches you Excel &amp; Tableau, which are things that are helpful to know regardless of what career you're pursuing. <br><br>I would say there's a lot of group work though &amp; you are matched randomly, so if you like doing things independently, this may not be the class for you. But other than that all focus is put on homework (no exams) &amp; pop quizzes (based on the readings –– but they are super interesting anyways so). Take this class, you won't regret it!",

If you need to make presentations a lot this is a very beneficial class. Bascially, you'll learn how to make effective data visualizations and also powerpoint presentations that don't immediately put the audience to sleep.",
                    "21": "Very helpful in learning how to make an engaging presentation deck. Loved when we applied cognitive science ideas to explain why certain techniques are effective (ie: 3–4 items in Short term memory max, eyes filter for color easily) so I wish we did this more! Professor Franconeri is a great professor, so definitely recommend taking it with him.",

It's a large lecture based class and they genuinely expect participation out of every student which is weird.  You do learn some good work place applicable skills though, like info about Excel, Tableau, and presenting data in general.",
                    "24": "I actually really really enjoyed this class! Prof Franconeri is one of the best at NU... He's funny, relatable, and doesn't take the class to seriously. He and the TAs are also great at providing feedback. However, the grading is really weird. They take off decimal points for seemingly no reason which I didn't like. The guest speakers are so cool and great opportunities to learn about data and potential career paths. This is the most applicable class (to the real–world) that I have ever taken. It should totally be a BIP requirement imo because it deals with making slides and effectively displaying data.",
                    "25": "I really loved this class in terms of everything I learned, probably one of the most valuable classes in terms of learning tangible skills. Grading is honestly not very transparent or very generous which is my only complaint. Lectures were 3 hours but didn’t feel like it.",
                    "26": "The class was generally good. There were a lot of small projects and groups that got confusing. The TA also graded the assignment very slowly so you don't know where you stand in terms of grade. If you get a bad group then your grade will drop quite a bit.",
                    "27": "It was a good course, taught me how to organize information well and present it well. The professor was engaging in the class. However, grading was NOT clear as well as participation grades too. They seem to randomly grade you on participation as well as other assignments – often using peer feedback which wasn't good. You only get your grade the last week of the quarter. I did enjoy the guest lectures though.",
                    "28": "This class is so fun honestly. Prof Franconeri is a really engaging lecturer and he gives a lot of class time to do workshops (aka class time to do the homework). There is a lot of group work, but really it's not so bad. He listens to the class too, like at the beginning he asked us if we would rather have one group or multiple groups and just did what we voted for. He does take attendance which was kind of annoying but understandable. My biggest warning for this class is that it felt very heavy on the data side of things and less on the idea sides. Personally I took it for the idea side and, while I would still recommend it as an easy and interesting class, we did a lot more data stuff than I would have liked.",
                    "29": "This was an incredible class! I've recommended it to so many of my friends. Not only is it useful if you're working on presenting research or in the stem field, it's also useful for people in any field ––– I'm a journalism major, and this class genuinely made me a better writer. You learn how to make nice looking power points (which I had a lot of fun with), and hear from some really cool guest speakers (my favorites were the data journalists). There can be a bit of busy work at times ––– we often had to fill out a lot of peer presentation critique forms in very specific ways, but I still think this class was very worthwhile. Make sure you do the readings, too, if you take this class ––– the reading quizzes can catch you off guard!",

I learned so much and think about the content every time I look at any presentation now. The group work sometimes sucked because you can't choose who you're with, and the grading was really nit–picky, yet still not hard to get an A, just like 4.85/5 would be an example grade? Anyways I really recommend this class for anyone.",
                    "33": "A fun and engaging course that will teach you a lot about presenting! Professor Franconeri is hilarious and is an expert on the topic as someone who is currently leading a lab researching the psychology of presenting ideas. The TAs were great and provided structural support for the course. The three hour chunk was not bad besides being in the evening. Groupwork was challenging but overall not super time consuming.",
                    "34": "The course material is great, and it has already proven quite useful when designing presentations. However, I do feel that the course is a bit disorganized overall, and the Tuesday 5:00PM due dates were sometimes a bit difficult to remember.  Often times I felt lost in what needed to get done for each class, especially when additional readings included in pop quizzes were distributed in Canvas announcements and not shown on the syllabus. So, while the course is great conceptually, I believe it could benefit from better organization to help students feel a bit less lost.",
                    "35": "Okay, so about a week ago I would've said this is a \"must take at NU\", but its a bit more than that. This course is definitely super interesting, very laid back, and requires almost no outside work apart from a few readings (you get quizzed on them, but the quizzes are extremely doable even if you majorly skim and just get main points. Trust me. I suck at reading, and this was the chillest thing ever), some form submissions (yes this was HW sometimes) and a few group projects. There is also one major group project throughout, but its also nothing crazy (just a 5 min powerpoint that you perfect). The 3 hour meeting times also go by pretty fast since theres usually a lot of interaction, and overall Franconeri is the GOAT of enthusiasm.<br><br>HOWEVER, the grading in this class is, for lack of a nicer word, insane. There are zero rubrics, and everything is graded very arbitrarily. For example, I got a 4.38 / 5 on a  peer review. No feedback, no rubic. And it was presented as a completion grade. How was that number created? What was I supposed to do, write more? So theres little things like that add up and get annoying. An A and A– are still very doable, it's just the grading is a lot more arbitrary than you first expect.<br><br>THE MOST ANNOYING thing however is the participation grade. On the first day, Franconeri made a side comment about \"talking at least 3 times\", but presented it as more of a suggestion. After all, the comment was never brought up again, never encouraged again, and its not like they know my name anyways, right? It's not like Franconeri and the TA's secretly know all 50 or something students' names and are tracking us all quarter, right? So at the end of the quarter, they send us the participation grade formula, which shows that they not only were tracking us the whole time, but that we had to talk FOUR times in order to get a 100%, otherwise you get an 80% just for showing up. And if they caught you doing smth else on their computer, they take off more points. Which is a bit ridiculous they did all this behind our backs, without telling us. They never mentioned that they would be counting nor did they every encourage to \"talk at least 3 times\" apart from one side comment on the first day (which, by the way, it ended up being 4 times). Also, its one thing to simply say \"hey guys, please don't fool around on your laptops, or else we may deduct participation points\", because then everyone gets the message, and everyone in class will actually pay attention. Its another thing to never say anything and just secretly track us and then be like \"guess what!\".<br><br>Again, even with all this, an A and A– are very doable. And the content is very very interesting, and as a data science major I learned a lot more about psychological/cognitive effects than I previously thought about and feel a lot more knowledgeable about how to present data so that it sticks in peoples brains. I think I just needed to get that grading shenanigans thing off my chest, really."

                    "0": "Great low–stress ethics distro!",
                    "1": "This class wasn't hard, but it wasn't easy. Every test there are around 10–15 essay questions given beforehand (which is nice) but they were a lot of work. Weekly quizzes and meditation logs were pretty easy though. This class is more buddhism than psychology, but highly recommend if you need an ethics distro.",
                    "2": "This class is a great distro requirement as the lectures relate very well to real life. There are 2 medlogs that are short, 4 online quizzes from the readings, and 2 midterms. She gives you all the midterm questions beforehand so you can prepare for the exam which was very helpful. This is a great class and I highly recommend you take it",
                    "3": "Interesting class, I found that the meditation/mindfulness techniques have been helpful in other aspects of life. I would say it also gives you a different perspective which is kind of nice as well.",
                    "4": "I loved this course– Professor Grabowecky is so lovely and passionate about her work in this field, which made the topics much more interesting. It presented a new perspective on school and my life overall, which is not something that usually happens after a course. I believe this course did help me learn because we were presented with information and were also forced to engage with what we learned– like meditating in class or writing meditation logs to reflect on what we learned vs what we experienced",
                    "5": "TAKE THIS CLASS!! Yes it's an easy A, but you also learn a ton and it changed my perspective on life. You have 4 reading quizzes which are easy and open note, take home on canvas. Then you have two midterms, the first is just 4 questions, you pick 2 and you're given a list of possible questions beforehand. The second is the same as the first but there's also an open note, take home longer quiz you do afterwards. The essay questions aren't graded harshly and as long as you memorize your answers before you take the exam you're fine! I was worried because she switched the essay questions from being take home to in person but it was still easy to do if you put in the work before you take the exam. You also do 2 meditation logs graded for completion that are worthwhile and easy. Overall very easy to get an A, but you will still learn a lot! Definitely watch the TED talks she gave. Also, you don't need to go to lecture if you do the readings and vice versa.",
                    "6": "The topics are interesting and Prof Grabowecky is clearly very passionate on the topic, however, she is unfortunately a somewhat bland lecturer. That being said, the course was incredibly easy with a few take–home quizzes, 2 midterms with 2 short essay questions (list of 10–15 potential questions is released a week before the exam) that are graded very lightly, and a couple of 1–page meditation logs. Many people frequently skipped this class so the Prof said she may alter the structure next year to include more testing of in–class material to prevent this.",
                    "7": "It was very informative, and a joy to learn.",
                    "8": "Definitely take this class if you're looking for an ethics distro. Meditation logs, online quizzes, 2 exams that you get the questions before and then you have to answer 2/4 given on the exam. Interesting if you want to put time into it, but not required. Also, cool to learn concepts and apply them to real life. Can easily get an A, there are extra credit opportunities too.",
                    "9": "Easy A, grades are mostly the midterm and final exam but you're given the questions beforehand and they're not graded too hard.",
                    "10": "overall a good morals and ethics distro. sometimes the lectures were a little slow and dry, but then again that's also very \"zen\". Relatively easy quizzes, readings, and exams, so it is not hard at all to do well in this class. Prof. G is also the sweetest and nicest most calm person ever.",
                    "11": "Prof. Grabowecky is great! She is very passionate about the subject and really wants us to take something away from the course. The exams and assignments are all fairly easy; there's a little bit of reading for each class but otherwise not much of a time commitment outside of class. Would definitely recommend this if you have some interest in the subject and you're looking for an easy ethics/values distro or psych requirement.",
                    "12": "Easy class, a decent amount of work but it's all easy. Few people attend and you don't really need to, just kinda do the readings",
                    "13": "Easy A",
                    "14": "Great class, easy A if you can get into it (usually fills up during pre–registration). Professor Grabowecky is great – it is clear she truly wants her students to succeed, and the course structure reflects that. There is a midterm, final, 2 meditation logs (super easy), and 4 reading quizzes (you are given 24 hours to do them). You are given the exam questions ahead of time, and she picks 4 from that list to put on the test (of which you have to write responses to 2 of them). Not recorded, but you will be fine if you miss a lecture here and there (and Professor Grabowecky is up front about this). Definitely take this if you are able to!!",
                    "15": "I enjoyed this course to an extent. The professor is a well spoken teacher, however, it is hard to stay engaged for the entire 80 minutes.",
                    "16": "Light A. You can learn a lot in this class and can improve your life if you really try to apply the lessons to your life. Point of the class is not about the grade but to grow.",
                    "17": "This class was good to learn new perspectives of Buddhism within a psychology context. The lectures felt slow but the material was very interesting. This class is nice to take because you do not need to worry much about your grade (you will do well) and spend time contemplating and learning skills that can be helpful for life (how to be content, orient your perspective, help others, etc.)",
                    "18": "Brilliant instructor. I learned so much and will definitely take what I've learned outside of the classroom.",
                    "19": "I took this course as a distro, and would definitely recommend.",
                    "20": "The class is very easy – for the most part, all students have to do is follow the readings. However, lectures are interesting because we do meditation practices as a class.",
                    "21": "so easy",
                    "22": "Pretty easy A. Slightly more involved this quarter than historically, but not hard for NU standards. I thought the readings were interesting (very very very repetitive too as is the whole class) and the topics were applicable to current–day dilemmas, but some of the readings were kind of long. Quizzes were mostly easy, but some questions were a bit tricky. Exams were not hard if you completed readings and could apply all the concepts learned in the class from the start. Lectures are not really necessary to attend though I always went, but everything is covered in the readings. Some aspects of quizzes and the MC part of the final midterm were only discussed in class, but one could make an educated guess. I won't lie; I struggled not to fall asleep in every lecture. However easy psych elective and ethics distro. (Might not be an ethics distro for long so take it while it is still available)",
                    "23": "This is a good course to take if you need a decently easy psychology course. I will say that the midterm and the final are almost all of your grade so you do need to actually learn the information, but it's not difficult to study.",
                    "24": "Liked the content, but NOT a easy A class anymore",
                    "25": "Lectures and readings are interesting. Two in–class midterms, two reflections about meditation, and four quizzes about the readings. Good ethics and values distro.",
                    "26": "This course is super easy to understand. The course consists of weekly quizzes, 2 meditation logs, and 2 midterms. That's it. Overall, this course would really benefit from having a smaller class since we can engage in more meaningful conversations. I love the mediations that we do in class.",
                    "27": "Going into the quarter, I was super excited to take Buddhist Psych because I saw from previous ctecs that it changed people's perspectives on the world. While the class fell short in this regard because lectures were extremely monotonous, the class itself was super unstressful",
                    "28": "Very easy class, I only attended around 3 lectures and still did great. Just make sure you study for the exams though (the possible questions are given beforehand) to ensure that you get full credit. There are makeup quizzes to regain quiz and test points and the meditation logs are very chill, overall a great course.",
                    "29": "Loved this class and was very low stress. Very easy to be engaged and would highly recommend when taking a heavy load",
                    "30": "Good distribution class. She’s made the course slightly harder with in–person writing exams but still nothing that isn’t manageable.",
                    "31": "Quizzes, Midterm, Final Questions to midterm and final are given beforehand",
                    "32": "This course was straight–forward and easy. Prof. Grabowecky has a really soothing voice and is a little rambly so it can be hard to focus in lectures, but the canvas quizzes + in–class essays are very manageable (never felt stressed out at all by this class). I wish the lectures were more structured; the class started to feel really repetitive",
                    "33": "Great ethics distro/FD. <br><br>Very interesting topic. Lectures are not recorded, and professor expands on the topics a lot during lectures, so go to them and take notes. <br>Decent amount of readings, but they work hand in hand with lecture topics.<br><br>4 quizzes throughout the quarter, focused on readings.<br><br>2 exams, you write 2 in–class essays. She gives you a study guide of all the questions that may appear. Go to the review session for them! She basically answers them.",
                    "34": "one of my favorite courses i've taken so far! having some prerequisite knowledge of Buddhism from Religion210 was definitely helpful in the beginning stages of this class, but totally not necessary because Prof Grabowecky was a g. There were a couple opportunities for extra credit which was greatly appreciated and the exam format was so kind.",
                    "35": "Recommend, quite easy and lectures optional.",
                    "36": "It was an easy class and it had many  interesting topics. Prof. Grabowecky is very nice and a good lecturer.",
                    "37": "i actually really enjoyed this class. like most others, I was taking this class as a distro requirement, but I ended up taking away a lot of good lessons from this class that I see myself implementing for a while now. you get what you put into the class for sure, and def a good ethics/values distro option.",
                    "38": "This class was alright, but what I really enjoyed was the meditation sessions during class! However, the lectures tended to feel dense and dragged on for quite a while. Getting an A isn't easy, but it's definitely achievable if you attend class, keep up with the quizzes, and review the study questions before exams. Unlike before, exams are now in–person, so you need to invest time in studying and memorizing the material. It required a lot of effort, especially since many of the exam questions weren't directly covered in lectures, so I had to do additional research. Despite that, the quizzes every two weeks and the reading logs (which I actually found enjoyable) with extra credit opportunities helped balance things out. The professor is really kind and supportive, always wanting what is best for her students to succeed.",
                    "39": "Easy Class. The concepts are so abstract and wishy washy that it can be confusing when studying for the exams. Low time commitment.",
                    "40": "I think that this course is exactly what you would expect: a course about buddhism and its psychological effects. However, the course itself is fairly uninvolved and disengaging because the lectures feel extremely long and boring most of the time. It is clear that the professor knew all of the material and is passionate about her work, but it did not translate well into her lecturing. Her slides were lack–luster, and it felt like a lot of rambling. However, the course content itself is pretty interesting and the exams and quizzes were pretty straightforward and simple if you prepared for them. You always knew exactly what to expect. The course readings felt a little extraneous and boring.",
                    "41": "Pretty easy class: lots of opportunities to succeed and do well. Readings are pretty short and only really relevant for reading quizzes. The midterm and final were no longer open note, but you still get the questions ahead of time.",
                    "42": "I absolutely loved this class! It was one of the least stressful classes I've had at the school, which I really appreciated because it gave you so much more time to really engage with and enjoy the material instead of rushing through it.",
                    "43": "Awesome class to take as an elective and easy to get an A unless you really don’t try. We meditated at the beginning of every class which I really enjoyed. Learned about Buddhist principles and will definitely remember this class as one that stands out at NU!",
                    "44": "Grade is largely based on 2 midterm/final exams. Pretty easy to study for since we get material before the actual exam takes place. Definitely some interesting concepts that come up from Buddhism.",
                    "45": "This class is my favorite psychology course here so far. Professor Grabowecky is incredible – so passionate and always willing to discuss topics in depth outside of class. You will get out of this class what you put into it. You should really try to interact meaningfully with the material. If you do, you will do well and also get a lot out of the course personally.",
                    "46": "Take this class!!! It is chill in the best way possible. Prof Grabowecky genuinely wants the class to do well and makes exams accessible. She holds review sessions and provides possible questions beforehand. Personally, I watched the lectures online, (she posts the 2021 lectures in files) and I absorbed the information much better. Overall, highly recommend. it is a great distro and psych class.",
                    "47": "Take this class if you can.  The professor is very nice and wants her students to do well.",
                    "48": "Easy A, exams are very straightforward as they are the same as the practice questions given before the exam",
                    "49": "Easy A as long as you study 2–3 hours (if even) for each in–person exam.",
                    "50": "this class was so chill. you only have 2 in class written essays as exams.",
                    "51": "Interesting class with super easy exams (you get the essay questions in advance).  Low time commitment and you don't really need to go to lectures. There are a couple canvas quizzes which were open book + the meditation logs were interesting to write and quick to do as well.",
                    "52": "This is a relatively easy class that I recommend anyone to take, but it is important to be on top of your work and all of the due dates because there are a lot of mini assignments and quizzes.",
                    "53": "Interesting class and tests were not super hard at all, professor is very knowledgable and reasonable",
                    "54": "This is a fun and low–key class. You're given everything you need to in order to get an A, so it's just a matter of effort.",
                    "55": "Very very interesting class! I find myself being able to use the Buddhist concept in daily life and it helped me become a more mindful person. The reading quizzes and exams are not too hard since the concepts are pretty intuitive.",
                    "56": "Pretty interesting class and very easy. You don't really need to go to class but I still recommend going because you cover some interesting things. Highly recommend if you want a fun easy distro",
                    "57": "Not the most engaging class, but a good somewhat–interesting, easy class to take to make the quarter more manageable! Readings are interesting but long, and not necessary to get an A. Only two exams (two short 300 word essays, and she gives a bank of possible questions ahead of time), a few open–note canvas quizzes outside of class, and two short meditation logs. The class is set up to have a lot of grade buffers, and she genuinely wants everyone to get an A!",
                    "58": "I really loved this course! It helped me learn about a new worldview/practice that is very different from how we are used to seeing the world, which I appreciated. She has made some changes from previous years, like the lectures are no longer recorded and exams are in person on paper, but it still wasn't too much extra work because she gave us lots of practice exam questions ahead of time, 4 of which were on the actual exam. If you need an easy ethics or psychology requirement, definitely take this course!",
                    "59": "This course is AMAZING! It is not an easy A, but is manageable if you put in some time and effort. Professor Grabowecky is so kind and helpful if you have any questions. I would HIGHLY recommend this course if you have a heavy courseload, but need a fourth class.",
                    "60": "Could not recommend a class more.",
                    "61": "The lectures varied in which some of them were interesting while others were difficult to pay attention to. The midterm exams were very straightforward since she gives you all the possible essay questions beforehand and you basically have to memorize key concepts that you want to include. Not very time consuming at all and Professor Grabowecky is one of the sweetest and most understanding teachers I've had so far.",
                    "62": "I was able to learn a lot of information about Buddhism and different meditation practices. The lectures were not recorded but the slides and previous years' were uploaded, and in each lecture you do a meditation practice. The quizzes are reading and lecture based, and some of the readings are pretty long. There are 2 midterms, but Prof. Grabowecky gives you a list of the possible midterm questions before hand.",
                    "63": "This class is very low–stress; as long as you do the readings (which are pretty short and not unreasonable) and attend lecture, you should no problem at all getting an A.<br><br>Before I took the course, I remember a lot of people describing this class as more of an intro to buddhism course than a buddhist psychology course, but I disagree. I think it is a great integration of the two. The material was interesting for the most part, but I will admit I did get pretty bored at some points",
                    "64": "This is an easy course especially if you really study the reviews for the exams",
                    "65": "THIS IS THE BEST DISTRO. You do not need to class, only to study for the midterm and final. Both have extra credit opportunities too.",
                    "66": "Professor Grabowecky is an excellent professor and the class was very fun.",
                    "67": "I loved this class! It's a pretty easy course (although, not as easy as it seemed to be during the pandemic/remote learning phase) and the materials were interesting. It's better to take this course with an open mind and like... if you actually care about learning some meditative practices, otherwise you'll be bored. I love Prof Grabowecky. She's great.",
                    "68": "Easy distro, but lectures are very bland.",
                    "69": "This course is popular for a reason! Not too time consuming for a distro, but also really good at opening up your worldview and giving you a new ethical and moral perspective. If you're taking this course in future years, *show up to lecture* because the Prof. suggested she'd make the exams lecture heavy (i.e. you couldn't just rely on the slides to do well) and she delivered.",
                    "70": "This was a fine class. It is a pretty easy A or A– and there is not much work–– four at home, open–note quizzes, two meditation logs, and two exams. For the exams, she gives you a list of essay questions to prepare ahead of time, presents 4 on the exam, and you pick the two you can write the strongest responses for. For the final, there also is a take home multiple choice section. Prof. Grabowecky hosts review sessions before each exam, and these really help you formulate your answers. However, the class itself definitely dragged, and a lot of people stopped showing up. By the end of the course, I feel like I only really picked up a few concepts, and I went to class every day. Definitely is not a bad class though. Prof. Grabowecky is very nice and super smart. If you need a class to fill a slot, or want an easy class to balance out a tough course load and need an ethics distro, this would be a good class for that. But, if you want a class that really draws you in and grabs your attention the entire time, I would not say this is that class.",
                    "71": "midterms are now in person hand–written essays, which makes the course a bit more difficult. However, overall still a very easy distro and quite interesting!",
                    "72": "Great instruction, I thought examinations were very fair, very interesting coursework.",
                    "73": "Very enjoyable class. You do need to study for the midterm and final. You can apply content to your own life and I have found myself being happier as a result.",
                    "74": "Greatest Distro and Psychology degree requirement class in all of Northwestern, and I'm not sayin that just cause this was a breeze of a class to get through, but you get through it while having a great time. Concepts in class give you a deeper perspective into a different culture and worldview, and is philosophically very interesting. Readings are mostly conversational and not too try (think self help book), and meditation is 10% of your grade. Students will be fighting tooth and nail to get into this class and it fills up every quarter. Exams are short quizzes on canvas every week or so (easy), and Prof Grabowecky literally gives you a list of questions that will be asked on the in class midterms. There are no curveballs, everything is extremely straightforward. If you fail to do well in this class it is totally on you ngl.",
                    "75": "This course is great! It is not hard to do well, as long as you keep up with the readings and attend the lectures. I would say that it was more a theology course than a psychology one. We learned about the philosophies of Buddhism with some learning about clinical applications or the brain activity of meditators. There are reading quizzes every few weeks, two exams, and meditation logs but they are not too difficult and are representative of the content. Overall, this is a decent, low–stress distribution requirement, but the lectures are not very engaging and the readings can be long.",
                    "76": "It was definitely an interesting course. The exams were now in person so had to do some studying but very easy as questions as given a week in advance. I went to almost all of the lecture but you could honestly get away with not going to them. The open note quizzes were pretty easy.",
                    "77": "very interesting class, pretty easy too. readings for every class but they were actually really enjoyable to read. lectures kind of drone on but otherwise good class. super easy A",
                    "78": "Great prof, learned about a whole new side of life and gained new perspective",
                    "79": "This course was really fun and interesting! Not too difficult and not too much work, and the only things you really had to do outside of class were the readings and two 1–page meditation logs.  Quizzes were open notes and both midterms had generously graded essay questions. I feel like the buddhist principles we learned are very applicable to everyday stresses, and, at least for me, I felt that my mindset shifted to be a bit more positive, open minded, and I felt more connected with others after taking this course.",
                    "80": "Good class where you learn a lot of information about Buddhism.  Not a huge time crunch. Prepare in advance for the exams and you will be fine.",
                    "81": "I enjoyed her meditation practices during class. They gave me the chance to reflect on myself and the events that had occurred in my life.",
                    "82": "Honestly the best class I've ever taken. The content we learned was extremely useful in easing my anxiety and helping me gain compassion for myself. I feel that I better understand what happiness is and how to achieve it in a lasting way!!",
                    "83": "Recommended distro but all prof does is TALK about the most random things for an hour 20. I went to class just to feel productive and every time I tuned in I was so confused at how random whatever she was saying was. It was so hard to focus even if I tried because she just uses the time to talk about her life. The takeaways I got from the content WERE interesting so I would recommend the class. Take home quizzes and meditation logs were easy and the finals are easy to ramble about, you can connect every topic to every question and just BS whatever",
                    "84": "Very interesting and great to learn some meditation practices. Lectures are dry but you don't need to go",
                    "85": "Quite a lot of reading but the content wasn't too difficult, the exam format was very convenient",
                    "86": "I loved this class. It's teachings of mindfulness and meditation have forever changed my perspectives on life and the people around me. Professor Grabowecky was a true treat, she is incredibly informative while still being enjoyable to watch lecture. If you can take this course, you should.",
                    "87": "The course structure consisted of four open–note quizzes, two one–page meditation logs, a midterm with two essay questions (which were provided in advance for preparation), and a final exam that also included a multiple–choice section similar to the quizzes. The professor also offered extra credit opportunities through quizzes, which was greatly appreciated.<br><br>Overall, the workload was quite manageable, making the course relatively easy.",
                    "88": "Class was made harder this quarter, midterms involved memorizing 11–14 questions with 250–300 word responses to each. Lecture was dry, professor wasn't bad. Extra credit was offered.",
                    "89": "Great class, Buddhist psych is actually very interesting because many of the concepts can be applied to mindfulness / attitude / thoughts in your everyday life",
                    "90": "This was a great class for the ethics distro! It’s super interesting and not a lot of work. It’s a great way to be introduced to Buddhism.",
                    "91": "Interesting class but hard to follow at times.",
                    "92": "The content of this class was pretty interesting and fun to learn about. The class was easy for the most part, but there are easier distros to take. There were 2 exams and 4 quizzes, so it's not as low maintenance as I was expecting. I still liked the course and the content was cool.",
                    "93": "has you do meditation in class, prof is very sweet, some guidelines on assignments very vague and general but she improved this throughout the quarter, very easy meditation logs, quizzes are online and doable only worth 2 points, there's extra credit opportunities and i will say the 2 big tests felt like a lot to study for because she'd give 12 – 15 questions and you pretty much had to understand/memorize your response to all of them as she would randomly choose 4 and you'd answer 2 of your choice for the test. there are common themes throughout the questions though, as long as you choose like the five most common topics and be able to connect each question to that because they appear in pretty much every question, you will do better than tr to memorize each question individually.",
                    "94": "Loved this course. Definitely requires review for the midterm and final, but not crazy and I recommend it as a distribution requirement class.",
                    "95": "Although Prof Grabowecky changed the structure of the class a bit, I still would not consider the class as difficult! The content is very interesting to learn, and her exams are very reflective of what we learn in class. She doesn't record lectures, so I would recommend going to class. She also has a review session before each exam, and they were so helpful when studying for the exams. I wouldn't say this is the easiest A, but it definitely was not difficult &amp; would still recommend for anyone who needs this as a distro / column C psych requirement.",
                    "96": "Pretty easy course to be honest. Liked the Professor a lot, but it was defintley meant for senior.",
                    "97": "Pretty easy class but she had said that next quarter she was going to start making the class more lecture based since no one was showing up to lectures so watch out for that. Easy A if you just pay attention and go to the review session for the midterm and final",
                    "98": "meditation was good and the course load was really easy",
                    "99": "not many people went to lectures",
                    "100": "I think it was cool to learn a new perspective on life, &amp; everything the course covered was pretty applicable. It was pretty easy though, just 2 meditation logs &amp; 2 exams that were writing–based, alongside some reading quizzes that are open–book. I wouldn't say I'm going to apply everything I learned in my life though, but it was cool to take this class.",
                    "101": "This is a pretty easy course. The exams are fair, and there are extra credit opportunities. The lectures are pretty boring (but you do get to meditate in class). The readings are also boring, and hard to engage with.",
                    "102": "I learned a lot about buddhism through this class, though I felt we didn't go too into the psychology aspects. The lectures can be a bit boring at times, but not that bad. Still, the professor is very passionate about the subject, and you can tell she wants to help us live happier/more fulfilling lives.",
                    "103": "Without a doubt easiest A at Northwestern. Extremely low effort, Felt like I was only taking three classes this quarter.",
                    "104": "Easy class. A few quizzes and 2 exams. Exam 1 was just two written essays (300–400 words) and the questions are provided beforehand. Exam 2 was similar, except there was a quiz component that was open note and take home. Overall, very easy while also being incredibly interesting. Made me join a Buddhism–related group that focuses on recovery as well. Great course, must take!",
                    "105": "Quizzes are tough, readings are long, and lectures are not super engaging. That being said, if you can pull everything together for the midterms, you'll probably be okay.",
                    "106": "This is such an interesting class. This class is what you make it. You can definitely get away with doing minimal work and still do well, or you can really engage with the material and integrate it into your life if you want to put in the extra time and effort. Professor Grabowecky is the best!",
                    "107": "I found the meditation logs to be incredibly valuable and enriching, as they provided me with a space to deepen my connection with myself and explore my inner landscape more fully. Through the practice of meditation and the act of journaling my experiences, I was able to cultivate a greater sense of self–awareness and introspection. The meditation logs served as a mirror, reflecting back to me my thoughts, emotions, and sensations with clarity and insight. They allowed me to observe the fluctuations of my mind and gain a deeper understanding of my inner workings. Moreover, the process of writing down my reflections helped solidify my insights and integrate them into my daily life. Overall, the meditation logs have been an invaluable tool on my journey of self–discovery and personal growth, enabling me to come into better touch with myself and deepen my understanding of who I am.",
                    "108": "Easy A. Readings are long and time consuming, but helpful on understanding some deep concepts and necessary for doing well on the reading quizzes. Lectures are pretty boring, and the content gets more intuitive and interesting as the quarter continues. Easiest class I've taken at Northwester, but still pretty interesting as long as you take notes at every lecture and actually write out the exam questions she gives to you prior to the exam. There is no reason to do bad in this class unless you completely don't go to lecture.",
                    "109": "Awesome class. Professor Grabowecky clearly cares a lot about the subject and takes pride in educating her students. Definitely take the class.",
                    "110": "Interesting course. Not very stressful but learned a lot.",
                    "111": "This is a very very easy ethics distro. However the class is not interesting and the lectures are very disorganized. The class is also more focused on the history and spirituality parts of Buddhism and rarely feels connected to psychology. The class has 4 take–home quizzes, which are open note and gave you way more time than you need for the number of questions. There's also two meditation logs, which are only a page and graded easily since they're subjective. There's also two exams consisting of two short answer essays, but she gives you a list of questions beforehand, so if you just prepare for those, the exam only takes 20 minutes. Overall, very easy class where the readings and attending lecture are not at all necessary, but the content isn't interesting unless you're super interested in Buddhism and its terminology.",
                    "112": "Take this course! Definitely a great Column C if your studying psych/ethics distro. I would say that you learn more if you put effort in to doing the readings and attending lectures, but you do not have to in order to do well in the class. Professor Grabowecky wants the best for her students, so she provides all the potential exam questions in advance and provides extra credit opportunities. As long as you prepare for the essay questions, you will definitely end with a good grade. In other psych classes, having your grade heavily weighted on exams can be difficult, but in this class I found it much easier to get an A. I also found the content to be very interesting and found myself applying the content we learned to my own life. We also meditated each class, which was enjoyable!",
                    "113": "The class was interesting.",
                    "114": "This course turned me off Buddhism and Psychology. Professor Grabowecky is a sweetheart and does genuinely care for her students, but her lectures were dry and mind–numbing. It was difficult to pay attention and sometimes it felt like she was just going on tangents. I recommend taking Intro to Buddhism instead.",
                    "115": "this course was amazing. the professor was super sweet and helpful. she's passionate about the subject and that really comes through. the readings are long so I didn't do them all, but the content was super interesting. exams were easy. tons of ec opportunities. she really wants you to get an A. it's a great class to take for the psych major. she really cares about the students and we get to meditate in class which is fun. take this class if you can!"

Her office hours are super accessible and engaging as well, I went every week. Not too much work– there are textbook readings plus other readings you definitely have to do as they are asked about in the exams. Three exams, finished up before Thanksgiving break. The tests are a combination of multiple choice,  fill in the blank, and short answer. The exams are extremely fair– she gives review questions before each one that relate exactly to what will be on the exam. There are also three short writing assignments. Overall a fantastic class, definitely recommend.",
                    "1": "this course is great! so well organized with reading questions that studying was easy and not intimidating. Renee is a great lecturer and keeps the class engaging even through heavy subjects.",
                    "2": "This was probably one of the best classes that I've taken at NU so far. Prof. Renee is such a wonderful lecturer and wholesome human being, and there was never a day I didn't look forward going to class/office hours. As for the course itself, everything was well organized, and the expectations for exams and assignments were pretty clear from the start. There are 3 non–cumulative exams and 3 IRs (short informed responses), along with some super low–stakes in–class participation activities. If you attended lectures, did the readings, and completed the review questions as a study tool (definitely recommend starting early and breaking them down into smaller chunks!), you were pretty much guaranteed to do well in this course, since the exams only covered material that was mentioned in the review questions.",
                    "3": "Best class I have taken so far at NU. Prof Engeln is truly a fantastic professor! Take this class!!",
                    "4": "More difficult than people let on. There's lots of readings, and all of your grade is made up into basically three exams. They're difficult. BUT it's a fun class and Engeln is a great professor.",
                    "5": "Take this class if you are at all interested in clinical psychology! It covers a lot of ground and the textbook lays everything out very clearly. Renee is an AMAZING instructor and her lectures are super engaging. The exams are scored kinda harshly sometimes (specifically the SAQs) so they require a bit more studying than just memorization, but are not that bad.",
                    "6": "Amazing class if you are interested in clinical psychology!! Renee is wonderful and her lectures are very engaging. Make sure to do all the readings and go to lectures to do well in this class.",
                    "7": "PROS<br>– Renee is awesome, she's such a friendly professor who genuinely seems interested in her students and the material<br>– The content is interesting<br>– The work amount is very reasonable<br><br>CONS<br>– I feel like we somehow did not cover enough like we would cover such little material in class which left a lot to self–study<br>– Exams can be unnecessarily tricky<br>– Classes sometimes felt dull as again we covered very little yet the class always lasted their entirety",
                    "8": "The workload was not overwhelming considering this is a 300–level class. All the readings were pretty interesting, some highly fascinating.",
                    "9": "I recommend this class to any and everyone! Renee is a phenomenal instructor who is passionate not only about the subject matter, but also in ensuring that students take away CORE information, not just trivial details. This class offered me a paradigm shift in understanding therapy, various psychological disorders, clinical psychology, and implications for American society. Renee makes learning and engaging so EASY! She gives students review questions at the start of each unit to guide our textbook reading and allow us to start studying ahead. If you answer and review the questions thoroughly, you'll do very well on exams. There are 3 Informed Responses which are mini \"papers\" comprised of 4–5 questions hitting on key ideas of the course. Renee and the TAs make themselves readily available to any and all questions. If you keep up the work throughout the quarter, there's no reason you can't succeed.",
                    "10": "Renee is probably the best professor you will have at Northwestern. Her lectures are very interesting and engaging. I would highly recommend this class – or just any class that Renee teaches really. However, this class is probably not a \"free A\". You will need to study a fair amount and keep up to date on the material. Although, the material is very interesting so that shouldn't be much of a problem.",
                    "11": "I was able to learn about different types of mental disorders.",
                    "12": "I learned a lot from this course. However, it is very lecture and textbook heavy (if you miss one class you fall BEHIND). Classes are not recorded and require three midterm exams.",
                    "13": "This class was really fun. Renee is an amazing lecturer and makes every lecture enjoyable. She even brought in some cherry tomatoes that she grew in her garden. The material was not that hard as long as you are able to memorize and differentiate between different disorders like anxiety, depressive, and personality disorders. The readings were pretty interesting as well. This class consists of three midterms and no finals, so you get to finish the class before reading week!",
                    "14": "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Northwestern. It is one of the hardest psych classes I've taken because there is so much content, but the exams are incredibly fair. Prof. Engeln is such an engaging lecturer. She can teach so much content in a short period and not make it overwhelming. You can tell that she loves to teach and she loves to engage with students, which makes the class that much more enjoyable. If you're interested in learning about mental disorders and institutional systems that affect mental health treatment and outcomes, this is the class for you.",
                    "15": "This class is AWESOME. Engeln does a great job explaining all the topics in depth, and she will never trick you on an exam. This class has 3 non cumulative midterms, no final, and one assignment before each midterm. If you show up and take notes, it's pretty easy to get a good grade. Review questions are provided after each exam and for every assigned reading, so do the readings. The review questions provided for you are the best way to study. As a neuro major, this class was a super interesting insight into the DSM and the current debates going on in the field of psych. Prof. Engeln and the TAs are super helpful and always willing to talk to you/help you with anything you might have questions about. I would definitely recommend this class for anyone who's interested in knowing more about DSM diagnoses and how they work in real life. The assigned readings can be a little long at times, but they are usually at least interesting, and you can certainly skim them to get the idea of what they are saying.",
                    "16": "I think that overall the course does a great job of engaging students in the material. The workload is manageable. I do think that the exam questions are a little all over the place.",
                    "17": "Renee is such an engaging professor! She really wants to make sure you're learning! T",
                    "18": "I HIGHLY recommend this course with Renee Engeln!! She is so genuinely enthusiastic and genuine with her students, and the exams and final are all very doable (I studied the day before for all of them and I have an A in the class as my final grade). She is a very engaging lecturer, and this class (in the fall) was done before thanksgiving which was so gorgeous. Again, highly recommend, you’ll learn a lot with very little stress",
                    "19": "Really good class, just do not expect to get your grades back quickly for anything",
                    "20": "The professor is really amazing. The content is interesting. The exams can be a bit tricky, so study a lot. Studying the review questions is extremely helpful. Keep up with hem through the quarter for a easier study time before the exams. Study sessions are fun and helpful.",
                    "21": "I was really interested in the subject matter of this class and I enjoyed it a lot. This course is so good and a great foundation for anyone interested in psych at all.",
                    "22": "Professor Engeln was the most engaging, dedicated professor I've had at Northwestern thus far and I am already eager to take another one of her courses. In Psyc 303, the material covered a foundation on mental illnesses, without feeling heavy or uninteresting. Before each class, assigned readings consisted of textbook chapters as well as relevant articles that brought a current, real–world application to the content. While they were difficult to keep up with at times, once you ensure to catch up after class and eventually got them done before the exam, it is still more than possible to succeed. Additionally, the reading and lecture questions were a supportive and thoughtful resource that provided a great, effective structure for exam preparation. On top of exams, we had informed response assignments that encouraged us to engage with the material in a real–life context. With 3 midterms and 3 informed reading responses, the assessment methods were fair and manageable. All in all, I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in psychology and mental illnesses.",
                    "23": "This course was fascinating. Renee is a great teacher who pushes us to think deeply about certain topics, not just understand them. The course was three non–cumilative tests and three Informed Responses (which had about 6 questions max and helped us learn) that we were graded on. Tests were hard but graded fairly, and IRs were also very doable.",
                    "24": "This course is AMAZING, I learned so much and it is so valuable for every psych major to take. With that being said, it is NOT an easy class. Very difficult and specific exams and quite a demanding load of readings/fast pace. Renee is incredible, and I say it's worth it since I'm leaving with so much knowledge.",
                    "25": "renee is absolutely amazing, the best professor i have had. tests can be difficult, but literally just focus all your effort on understanding the study questions she gives. no need for more or less, i made study guides of just that and tests were able to be done well",
                    "26": "PLEASE take this class if you're interested in psych. I'm not currently a psych major but this made me want to be because of its focus on people and brain functioning. Prof Renee makes class so fun and brings great energy to every lecture. From pictures of cute wildcats to weekly check–ins and mental health challenges, this was always a highlight and I always felt engaged. The textbook reading can be really heavy so space the work out. Most importantly, don't try to read the whole thing. Look at the review questions ahead of time and then skim, then go back to what you need to know. The exams are HARD but fair. If you take detailed notes and do all the review questions, you should do okay. <br><br>The class is 3 \"informed response\" assignments (which is just a few sentences with citations in response to a few questions) and 3 exams.  Lectures are not recorded so you really should be at class everytime you can go. The course is spaced out really well: it never feels like you have a lot of upcoming things. Just plan to study 3+ days ahead of an exam so you can go over all the review questions. This class is amazing no matter what year you're in.",
                    "27": "I could go on and on about this class but heres the gist: this is a great class, with a fantastic teacher, and a manageable workload. If you're interested in this topic or have to take this class for a requirement, take it. <br><br><br>Also, make sure to do the review question early before the tests if you want to do well.",
                    "28": "Good material and very interesting material.. however sometimes things can get too technical and its dSm all the time. Renee is a good lecturer and very personable so the content is digestible. however her tests were unnecessarily hard for no reason. questions to trick u small things from readings etc. it was so unstraightforward and time consuming to even read the test q options because there were options to jsut trick u.",
                    "29": "I really enjoyed the lecture and course materials. Prof Engeln leads the class through all of these difficult subjects really well. However, the exams took a lot of effort to study for yet it felt really difficult to translate the effort into successful results given the trickiness of the questions.",
                    "30": "Absolutely LOVED this course. Renee does an amazing job of keeping the lectures interesting and encouraging students to engage and work together. Never got bored during lecture and the extra reading material outside of class was very interesting. Not a lot of assignments at all and the exams are very doable with a little bit of studying.",
                    "31": "I will be one of many students to say this class was EXCELLENT. Renee is a super fun professor who genuinely puts the welfare of her students first. The readings were super interesting and were always somehow referenced in class. The IRs were pretty fairly graded (even if they were done in an untimely manner) and so were the exams. Her exams are not tricky at all, it is the exact same content contained on the study guide.",
                    "32": "There are 2–3 readings per class and they are not optional because there are questions on the test based purely on the readings. It's three noncumulative midterms but they have multiple choice, short answer, and long answer. There are also IRS which would be easy enough except in my case the grading is weirdly specific. Every disease walks a grey line and its like they expect you to always answer both sides while being in a sentence limit.",
                    "33": "Engeln is an amazing professor. This class is super engaging and definitely worth taking.",
                    "34": "this class was amazing. Renee is the absolute best: she's super nice, very engaging, and answers questions very well. she taught the content in a digestible manner. the IR assignments weren't too bad and the readings were really interesting. the exams are a little hard because the content is dense, but if you do all of the review questions its not too bad.",
                    "35": "One of the best classes I've taken at Northwestern with one of the best professors here.  Great lectures and slides and fantastic teaching style, engagement, and enthusiasm.  Exams are not a joke so prepare well but you are given all the tools to succeed.  The only problem is the readings are super long when I feel they often did not have to be.",
                    "36": "Loved lecture! Not a terrible amount of work. Exams are heavily weighted (70%)",
                    "37": "renee is an amazing professor. she provides review questions for every test, and if you can answer those you are basically all set. there are a few questions on each test that are not covered in the review questions, but as long as you go to class you should be fine and if you miss a few its not a big deal, especially since she often curves the tests by an extra point or two. when I did the readings I only focused on finding the answers to the review questions and that worked out well for me. this class was probably my least stressful of the quarter because the expectations were always clear and i was given the tools to succeed",
                    "38": "I loved this course even if it was very challenging. You really have to stay on top of the readings and you have to take really detailed notes on what the professor says. I really learned so much in this course. Exams were challenging and you have to really study to get a good grade. Office hours are a must! The Independent Response Assignments give a small boost but grading can can be very picky at times. Take this class with Engeln!! She is an amazing speaker and I is great at keeping students engaged in lectures.",
                    "39": "Take this class with Renee! People in the CTECs said that her lectures are like going to a TED talk and they were right! She's such a good lecturer and very very fair on grading and test questions. THIS IS THE BEST CLASS IVE TAKEN AT NU, coming from a senior!!",
                    "40": "Review questions are posted before each exam so you know exactly what you are studying for. If you actually do the questions the exams are pretty straightforward. Lectures are very interesting and engaging, and so is the assigned reading. Definitely show up to every lecture and write down every word being said though, or you may miss something.",
                    "41": "Great class! Prof. Engeln is amazing, super communicative, super invested in the class!",
                    "42": "On top of being a really interesting topic, Renee teaches this class amazingly.  She's super engaged and makes the lectures very entertaining.  There is a lot of reading but the articles assigned were very interesting and definitely topical.  Material itself is not too difficult but doing the readings and going to class/filling out review questions were definitely necessary.",
                    "43": "This class was excellent! The lectures were so interesting and Renee is amazing at engaging interest and making the content fun! We had 3 short assignments and 3 midterms. The midterms could be a bit difficult, but Renee always made clear what we needed to study with the review questions that she posted.",
                    "44": "PROFESSOR RENEE IS A–M–A–Z–I–N–G!!! Though there is indeed a lot of content to go over, Prof Renee still managed to make every lecture super engaging and fun by adding so many cute pics of wildcats and memes and interesting interactive activities. Besides class time, Prof Renee is also super helpful—on top of the two office hours per week, she also hosted study hours on Fridays before exam where she would always bring tons of snacks and share even more fun memes:) The course content is a bit hard but manageable if you ACTUALLY read the textbook, do the review questions, and go to office hours. The IRs are challenging but also fun to write. After all, Renee is just an amazing person beyond her role as a fantastic professor.",
                    "45": "TAKE THIS CLASS! I'm a psych minor, but I didn't really do a lot of psych besides intro before this class, and it's one of my favorite classes so far as a sophomore. Professor Renee Engeln is amazing at lecture and super engaging, and highlights the interesting material in the class. She also answers a lot of questions in class, so the lecture class feels almost discussion based. Exams are fair – mostly multiple choice with short response. Professor has office hours often during the week and I only went to hers since the TAs hours didn't line up with my schedule. She is super helpful during office hours and seems to honestly care about students study and interest in the material. Only thing that I would complain about is sometimes the main textbook has too much information, but professor Renee provides a helpful reading and lecture review questions which then reduces what you actually have to review for in the exam. The other readings on psychopathology (news articles, studies) are also interesting! It's a lot of work, but you get a lot of enjoyment out of it too!",
                    "46": "If you're interested in psychology, I'd absolutely take this class. Renee walks you through things super clearly, and while a lot is covered, it never feels overwhelming if you keep up with the classes. You will need to read the textbook, but she tells you exactly what you need to learn–– it's a very fair class, with very fair tests. Definitely recommend!",
                    "47": "ENGELN IS THE BEST! take this class –– it's only 3 short answer assignments and 3 exams and she provides study questions/opportunities for review outside of class. i loved it and learned a lot",
                    "48": "This course was a very interesting introduction to psychopathology, and the content was made even more interesting with Prof. Engeln's engaging lecture style and thorough knowledge of the material. One difficult part of the course is that the final grade depends essentially on 3 written assignments and 3 exams, so studying throughout the course is necessary for keeping up. The reading review questions and lecture review questions are the best way to prepare for the content that will be on the exam, so focus on those questions. Focus on writing detailed notes in lecture as the lectures aren't recorded and the slides are pretty minimal.",
                    "49": "The course consists of 3 exams. I would not say the exams are “ an easy A.” They are definitely doable but some questions can be challenging. The exams consists of Multiple choice questions, fill in the blanks and Written responses. Make sure to study or you will fail!",
                    "50": "This course was extremely effective at covering a variety of mental disorders (how the present, are diagnosed, potential causal factors, treatment, etc.). Renee is an actual angel and is always super energetic, caring, engaging, and receptive. This is probably my favorite class I've taken so far. There supplemental and textbook readings, but they're usually really interesting and are useful in answering review questions that are an amazing study tool for exams.",
                    "51": "This course is absolutely amazing. Renee is probably one of the best professors I've ever had at Northwestern– I actually took this class just because of how much I enjoyed her Psych 110 class. There is definitely a lot of reading in this class, but I found many of the articles to be extremely interesting because they weren't just repeating information we already learned in class. A lot of them offered perspective I never would have considered and I found them very valuable to read. This class's grade is made up of 70% exams, but I found that they were graded kindly and the other assignments helped to make me never feel like this class was *too* difficult. Overall, just a really interesting and rewarding class that I highly recommend!",

                    "53": "take psychopathology with professor engeln!! she is super engaging and a great professor. you go over a lot of material – looking back i do wish we could have gone over less material and more in depth but i understand there is a lot to cover <br><br>3 midterms and 3 short answer assignments. exams def take a lot of prep just because there is a lot of material but they are very reasonable exams – like 35 ish multiple choice and short answer questions,",
                    "54": "PSYCH 303 was definitely my favorite course this quarter. I always looked forward to attending each class and Renee was great. PSYCH 303 was always my fourth class of the day but I was still able to very attentive after a long day. I thought the exams were fair and the IRs were good as well. The IRs are a like a couple questions you have to answer using your notes or readings. I would say there were a lot of readings and if you fell behind it sucked bc it was a lo to catch up on, but the readings were always very interesting, I would definitely recommend this class!",
                    "55": "I loved this course!",
                    "56": "BEST PSYCH CLASS I'VE TAKEN! ESPECIALLY WITH PROFESSOR ENGELN! She makes the material so interesting that lectures don't even feel like lectures. The exams were very reasonable––if you go to class and do the study guide you'll be totally fine.",
                    "57": "3 Midterms, 3 writing assignments. Class finishes before thanksgiving/reading week so one less final to worry about. Renee is a ray of sunshine in the depressing dark and cold. Lots of enthusiasm and warmth. Genuine interest in teaching the class and builds a really great rapport with students. Exams are MCQ, fill in the blanks and short answer questions. Take detailed notes in class because a lot of what you need to know is spoken out loud and not on the slides (I struggled with this because I naturally zone in and out). Need above a 94% to get an A in the class and with so many assignments there is no room to slip–up. Felt like it was more difficult to get an A in this class than most other psych classes I have taken. DEFINITELY go for OH before submitting the writing assignments. Super useful. Amazing TAs!",
                    "58": "so. much. reading. and the lecture slides were sparse so if you were tired or if you have ADHD or something, good luck studying. most of what i learned from this course was through the readings because if you don't do the readings, you will probably fail the test. I think i spent the most time on this class out of all my classes, and I feel like i only actually learned very little because a decent amount of what was assigned was repetitive. You know the saying, work smarter not harder? there is no possible way to work smarter in this class. I don't think I would recommend this course.",
                    "59": "I found the class to be very interesting and easy to stay invested it, with a lot of interesting readings and articles assigned to illustrate the topics of class and tie–in to the 'real world' experience of mental illnesses. I thought there were a lot of good resources to engage with if you were confused on a certain area."

These issues are super relevant in our world –– especially among college students –– so I found it changed the way I think about these things. I do question whether brute force memorization is the best way of evaluation here:  your grade is based on three largely multiple choice tests where you have to memorize tons of details of readings and lectures. So be prepared for that.",
                    "1": "This class is AWESOME. Favorite psych class I've taken. Renee is an incredible lecturer and keeps you so engaged and wanting to come to class. The course structure is 3 exams and 3 longer HW assignments so very manageable. You MUST do the readings. Exams are tough but fair, and she gives review questions so you know exactly what material you're responsible for. Overall, the class takes work but its so interesting and rewarding in the end!!!",

Renee is so knowledgeable but still so approachable and really tries to make class interesting and fun. Also had 3 informed responses which were super short and informal. Would highly recommend this class with Renee to anyone interested in learning more about mental health and the diagnostic system.",
                    "4": "One of the most fascinating courses I've taken. Professor Renee is in a very engaging lecturer and the material is just as engaging. Take this if you can.",
                    "5": "TAKE THIS CLASS! Really take any class with Prof. Engeln, but definitely take this class. The readings are helpful and interesting, the lectures are insightful, and Prof. Engeln does everything she can to help you prepare yourself for the exams. If you put in the work, you got this.",

                    "7": "I was already interested in the material of this course and was not disappointed by it. Renee is a wonderful professor – she makes the content easy to pick up and learn, and the review questions are designed to make sure you know exactly what you're going to be tested on; you just have to make sure you know them thoroughly and you'll be fine. Recommend for any psych major/minors, and as a pretty interesting (though perhaps not necessarily easy) distro.",
                    "8": "Loved this course! Renee is the best! I found the content to be really interesting and challenged what I had previously thought about how psychological disorders are categorized and diagnosed. Your grade is composed of 3 non cumulative exams, 3 short response papers, and in class activities. If you just do the readings and go to class, you will be fine. I recommend this class and overall really enjoyed it!!",

                    "10": "This is a great course. Prof. Engeln structures the course in such a way that you are learning material in a good variety of ways– through lectures, readings, IR assignments, in class activities, etc. She is an AMAZING lecturer, so easy to talk to, and just seems like the kindest person. Her lectures make a course topic that is already super interesting something that is even more interesting to learn. Definitely not an easy A though, you will need to put in the work to learn course material as exams can be a little tricky.",
                    "11": "Would recommend this course for those interested in clinical psychology/neuroscience/medicine. Renee is extremely well–versed in the material and a great lecturer, but you have to do all the assigned readings because a lot of the exam content isn't explicitly covered in lecture. Attendance is part of your grade and exams make up the vast majority of your grade as well.",
                    "12": "Professor Englen is amazing! I was already interested in the content of this course, but even if you weren't interested, the material is engaging and cool to learn more about.",
                    "13": "This is a really solid course content–wise. 3 exams are 70% of your grade, 3 short writing assignments are 25% of your grade, and participation–based in–class activities are 5% of your grade. The grading was very fair and I feel like I learned a lot of interesting things. While exams are based on rote memorization, you will be given a list of review questions in advance of the exams that tell you exactly what you need to know for each one, and the exams aren't cumulative. That being said, you do have to go to every class because you will be tested on lecture content and lectures are not recorded, which was kind of annoying.<br><br>I know this is an unpopular opinion, but I am not a fan of Renee. She was really passive aggressive to me over email a few times near the beginning of the quarter, and I find it odd that she won't record lectures or even post her lectures slides when students are sick. Also, she said she doesn't even read CTECs which like ???? and she never asked for student feedback at any point during the quarter. I think one of the most important parts of being an instructor is listening to student feedback, but she never took any. Still, it was a fair and good class overall.",
                    "14": "Psycopathology was a fascinating class. I'm only a psych minor but it made me want to pursue a career in psychology. 100% take this class with Renee. Exams are hard and it's not an easy A but so worth it.",
                    "15": "Loved this course! Renee is great and the class is really interesting. She learned everyone’s names even in this big class and was very helpful in office hours. Class is very interesting and exams are super manageable because you just need to master the content on the review sheets to do well.",
                    "16": "The professor is definitely one of the best parts of this class and she really made the material interesting and engaging. She offers a lot of resources for the exams, but they still do require a lot f studying. Highly recommend this course to get into psychopathology and understand the field in such a depth with so many nuances. The class had so many fun activities such as reading comics and podcasts. There is mandatory attendance that counts for a participation grade.",
                    "17": "this is an amazing course for psych major – 100% take it and take it with Renee! tests aren't that difficult if you study a lot – there are 3 non–cumulative exams. very time consuming towards the exams but not a lot of work during the rest of the quarter",
                    "18": "Renee is great for this class, she is very engaging and clear about what you'll need to know for exams. You will need to read articles and textbooks for class (and know the content), which can be a bit time–consuming but Renee makes it easy to know what is important from these. Overall, great class!",
                    "19": "I really enjoyed Renee's teaching and loved this course/course material. Exams were tough, but IRs give you the opportunity to build your grade. If you take this class, take it with Renee!",
                    "20": "Awesome class! Engeln is so sweet and engaging, genuinely wants her students to succeed. I learned a lot about mental disorders in a very structured &amp; nuanced way. Three exams based entirely on review questions (so nice!) w/ three informed response assignments. Biweekly readings that were dense at times, definitely use the review questions to guide you.",

Readings are interesting and Renee's a really good lecturer. I also think my views of mental disorders changed– I feel like I had maybe stigmatized mental disorder before taking this class without realizing it, and this class challenged those views"

While there is relatively a lot of content, it is interesting enough that if you pay attention during lecture, it's pretty easy to remember. The exams are harder than the average psychology course's, but keeping up with the reading questions were the most helpful. The class slides aren't super helpful to look back on (pretty vague), which is why attendance and good notes are important in this class. I would recommend taking this class.",

The tests can be a bit difficult but she gives us review questions, and as long as you know the readings really well then you’ll be fine. I looked forward to every lecture and the topics were super interesting. I learned so much in this class, and i HIGHLY recommend if you’re interested in psychology. Overall it’s an easy class as long as you manage your time and know the readings/lectures/textbook inside and out.",
                    "5": "Felt like I learned a lot. Didn't realize how many of the things I thought I knew about mental disorders were actually misconceptions. The 6 responses you have to do are super short and chill and you also get to drop your two lowest grades. No final which is also cool and the three exams aren't bad at all. There are review questions for each exam which are SO HELPFUL. Everything covered on the exams are basically in the reading questions. As long as you take notes in class you can kind of just get away with cramming/not rlly doing the readings if you use the review questions to guide ur studying. Like most other psych classes I've taken here so far the exams are basically just straight memorization of vocab/concepts so if you're good at that this class will be very very chill. Prof Engeln is a really engaging lecturer and just very fun/personable overall so lecture was never really boring.",
                    "6": "I loved this class. Professor Engeln is fantastic and makes lectures engaging. She also makes an effort to get to know each of her students, even in this larger lecture class, and I enjoyed stopping by her office hours. The content of the course is also really interesting and relevant to today's society, and having current day articles helped showcase the application of what we were learning.

                    "10": "Renee is an incredible professor! I learned so much this quarter. Her expectations for students are 100% reasonable while still challenging us to learn and engage with the topics at hand. Exams were challenging, but not anything that you couldn't do with studying for a couple of days before the exam.",
                    "11": "Great course. Honestly took it because I didn't have anything else that worked with my schedule but definitely an engaging and interesting class.

I really liked how a lot of common misconceptions about mental disorders were talked about and disproved, in a way that was digestable and engaging. I would highly recommend this class. There are three exams, non–cumulative, and homework assignments. If you go to lectures and pay attention, keep up with the readings, this class is manageable.",
                    "13": "take this class! will change your entire perspective on diagnoses, mental health care, and your brain. renee is the best prof I have ever had at NU and I always looked forward to lecture. Exams are fine, just do your review questions!",

                    "15": "This class is amazing!!! I think everyone should look to take this course, even if you don't wish to be in clinical psychology, or even psychology at all. The course is so important for understanding so many of the misconceptions surrounding psychopathology, including schizophrenia, ADHD, anti–social personality disorder, major depressive disorder, and so much more. Plus, the course offers nuanced discussions of the effectiveness of clinical psychology and psychiatry, some of its dark history, and more of where it needs to go. As for the instruction, Renee is absolutely the best professor I have had at NU. The test review questions are so so so helpful for learning the material, and prepare you for everything that you will see on the exam. The lecture materials are very concise and clear. I will note that you will need to show up to class to do well. The lecture slides are not detailed, and you will miss a lot of the material if you are not engaged in the lectures. However, Renee makes it super easy to be engaged and want to show up to class. She is super postive, kind, enthusiastic, and genuinely passionate about teaching and about the topics at hand. She is always willing to talk to students after class, and offers office hours that could be anything from super in–depth test review to just casual chatting about the psych program. Overall, I cannot recommend this course enough.",
                    "16": "This class was so much fun. It defenitify is not an easy A but it is really interesting. The questions on the exam can honestly get a little difficult and confusing so just make sure to truly pay attention in class. She gives review questions and as long as you fill those out and study them with enough time you should be good.",
                    "17": "This is an amazing class. I was not too interested in the subject before taking but I ended up absolutely loving the class. The readings are not too dense and are very interesting. Professor Renee is an amazing lecturer who makes the class interesting. The exams are fair and the review questions she provides are extremely helpful. I highly recommend this class to everyone",
                    "18": "This class is really interesting. It combines basic DSM information about disorders with interesting op–eds and research. I learned a lot about the field of psychiatry.",
                    "19": "This course was definitely my favorite of spring quarter. Renee is so cool and such a great lecturer. She doesn't need her slides or notes but walks around the lecture hall, engaging with students as she speaks. We covered the core psychiatric diagnoses in the DSM 5 and even talked about how disorders are approached in clinical settings. I learned so much about the prevalence of disorders, how they are diagnosed and their limitations. There are a lot of readings but all were engaging and actually interesting to read. You must do the readings because they are on the exams but Renee gives you a list of questions to go off of. Exams can be difficult, especially the multiple choice, but if you put in the work it is manageable. To get an A, it is 95 or higher which is definitely hard but A– is pretty easily possible if you study for the exams. Out of all my classes, the information from this class is one that I want to hold onto because it affects how you interact and see other people.",

She loves all the students and loves engaging with them, but she also won't call on them. There are 4–6 Informed responses that have to be done, which is very fair, and they are very fair at grading it. There are also 3 exams that you have to study for, but since there are 3, they won't have too much information that is tested in each, it is doable if you study. Anyways, it is a lovely and super interesting course.",
                    "22": "I learned SO much in this class. Renee is a fantastic lecturer and is so engaging. There are 6 short informed responses (only a couple sentences for 3–4 prompts) throughout the quarter (you can drop two) and three exams (part multiple choice, part short answer) that require you to put in a significant amount of time studying, but as long as you are confident answering the review questions that are posted you should be fine. Do the questions after each reading/lecture otherwise there will be too much information to cram right before the test. Renee does a great job challenging common misconceptions related to therapy/psychopathology. This class required you to put in a good amount of work, but it is so worth it.",
                    "23": "I really loved learning the biology behind the disorders, and the criteria for each disorder. I liked how down to earth the class was, and I felt like it created such a great learning environment",

I really liked the instructor and professor Renee is really wonderful but the exam were too long and there were a lot of readings plus assignments. You can't miss a lecture because they are important for the exams. Office hours were very helpful for the homework and exams.",

The readings are extensive, but important. Professor Chung is a really wonderful instructor, and works hard to support her students!",
                    "1": "20% midterm 1, 25% paper 2, 25% midterm 2, 30% paper 2. <br><br>exams were super hard. multiple choice really really tricky. before the first exam told everyone that the goal is not to bomb the multiple choice, which in her mind was as long as you do better than chance.  she let everyone take the exams for 2.5 hours+ rather than the usually 80 min even though its 80 min of content. partially bc shes really nice and also bc its super hard. <br><br>so keep in mind you're going to have to study a lot. and do the readings from the textbook bc the mult choice questions take from it. like pretty small and specific details.  class average was a b on the first exam, second exam was way harder but im writing this before getting the grade back. papers you could send to her beforehand, and she gave really helpful feedback, so not hard to get a good score. <br><br>overall though shes super nice and really helpful and wants you to do well so she answers questions in a really honest and helpful way. this was a good class but at all an easy a. maybe an easy b+. im struggling for my a– rn.",
                    "2": "Take this class! Professor Chung is absolutely amazing. This is the best class I've taken at NU so far. If you want to be a therapist, this is the class for you. It was really interactive with engaging content and sooo many interesting case studies. The exams are easy enough if you take the time to study and I would suggest taking notes on the lectures. The workload is really manageable as well.",
                    "3": "Love Prof. Chung! Any chance you get to take a chance with her, take it. I don't even plan to become a clinical psychologist and I still found the content valuable. 2 papers and 2 exams. Ask questions, go to office hours, and build a relationship w/ prof bc she is incredibly flexible and just wants us to learn.",
                    "4": "I actually really loved this course! Professor Chung is awesome, and she's great to listen to when she lectures. The content was fairly straight forward and very interesting. There was a LOT of reading for this class (and you HAVE TO do the reading to do well on the exam), so that was sometimes difficult to manage time wise, but the content was at least super interesting. If you cab handle keeping up with a lot of readings, I would absolutely absolutely recommend this class!",
                    "5": "This course was a lot in terms of the readings &amp; making sure that you were studying in the most effective way possible. The beginning of the class focused on the basics and then delved into specific theories in application within therapy and then into specific areas under/connected to Clinical Psych. I definitely recommend taking this class if you are interested in Clinical Psych grad school. There were two main writing assignments – a case study where you apply one of the theories in therapy to treat a patient &amp; the final paper – with one midterm (MC, short answer, and essay) and one final (MC, short answer, and essay).",
                    "6": "Professor Chung is so sweet and competent. Definitely take this class with her, or any class! She’s great! She’s a great public speaker and is beyond well prepared to teach this class. She has so much experience and that makes the Q&amp;A part of class so exciting and interesting. She emphasizes at the first day of class that everyone is welcomed in office hours which made a huge difference. I have felt a bit scared of office hours because some professors come off as too busy for you. But the way she welcomes you is so reassuring and even though she is a busy women, she always makes you feel she has time to help you! She is so encouraging too! Her tests are challenging and very very long! Some questions are unnecessarily confusing, but overall straightforward. You do have to read for HOURS AND HOURS. That’s the only part I wish was different. It’s just an overwhelming amount of reading. No one actually ends up reading everything, and not everything is on the test so I just wish she would assign less readings or be specific with the parts that really matter.",
                    "7": "I loved this class. It was really interesting to see how clinical psychology works and all of its weaknesses as well. Professor Chung is a great lecturer and person and I always looked forward to going to class. There are 2 exams and 2 short papers (4–5 page case study and 5–7 page research paper). I highly recommend.",

                    "10": "Professor Chung is an incredible professor who is very passionate about clinical psychology! I definitely recommend this class if you are even the slightest bit interested in clinical psych, as professor Chung is still actively practicing and can provide a lot of insight and advice. As for the class itself, there were only 2 exams and 2 papers, pretty manageable. Reading was a little heavy (up to 2 textbook chapters a week) but overall manageable.  Exams were mostly based on lectures and textbook content. For the textbook, only study the highlighted and bolded terms  and the summaries at the end of each section. I also highly recommend going to office hours!",
                    "11": "I LOVE PROF CHUNG!!!! This class is challenging at times, and it can definitely be a lot of reading, but the material is so fascinating and it is also delivered in the most fun, engaging, and entertaining way. Prof chung makes this class what it is. Bravo, 10/10",
                    "12": "This is a great course! If you have any interest in clinical psychology, definitely take this course. It's very informative and Professor Chung is a great lecturer. She is so engaging and kind. You can go to her with any questions you have, related to the course, grad school, or careers. The course consists of two papers and two exams. If you pay attention in lecture and at least skim the textbook, you should be fine in the class.",
                    "13": "This is a great psych class! Super interesting material and Professor Chung brings her experience practicing clinical psych to the lectures, making them stimulating and knowledge building. The tests were doable and I did not find this class to be a stressor.",
                    "14": "I liked this class because there was a lot of interesting material that wasn't taught in other psych classes, like DBT and family systems therapy. Prof Chung is an animated talker, and is very understanding and clearly advocates our mental health over submitting an assignment by the deadline. Her exams are tricky though. I'd recommend just getting down pat the bolded terms, the \"in review\" boxes of textbook, and just knowing the lecture slides well for the exam. And you will do well on the papers if you ask Prof Chung to read and offer feedback on your research paper draft! I'd say go to Prof Chung's office hours at least once. And just ask her anything. She's great.",
                    "15": "Very interesting, professor Chung is great at teaching",
                    "16": "please go to lecture – i wish i went to more lectures (9:30am class), Prof Chung lectures very well and in a way that you actually remember the content bc it's so interesting",
                    "17": "Take this class! Professor Chung is so sweet and makes the classes really interesting!! There are 2 exams (non cumulative) and 2 papers which is very manageable. Her office hours are super helpful, overall one of my favourite classes at NU",
                    "18": "This is such an interesting course and a great introduction to the field of clinical psychology. I feel like I know a lot more about what clinical psychologists do and all the various areas within the field one can partake in. So, if you are considering taking that route, or are even slightly interested, I highly recommend taking this class. It is definitely one of the more interesting psychology classes I have taken at Northwestern. Prof. Chung is amazing! She is the sweetest professor ever. She is so understanding and is willing to help you in any way that she can whether it be questions about assignments, grad school, or anything else. She really cares about each and every one of her students. She also is a great lecturer, and you learn a lot from going to class.  Her enthusiasm and way of teaching really engrains the information in your head, and class never drags. While this is definitely not the easiest psych class I have taken so far, it is a manageable one–– two exams, a case study paper, and a research paper–– and definitely worth it.",
                    "19": "AMAZING class. If you are interested in pursuing clinical, this is a must–take class. In my case, it made me realize that I did not want to pursue a graduate education in psychology (which is equally as useful). The course is challenging –– exams and papers are tough –– but Professor Chung is one of the best and kindest professors in the psychology department. Truly a wonderful and engaging course, I'd recommend to anyone.",
                    "20": "Exam questions and grading of papers seemed to not reflect lectures and readings well.  The readings were way too long and way too many at a time.  Lectures were not very helpful and sometimes dry.",
                    "21": "This is an amazing class. A must–take for anyone interested in clinical psychology. Professor Chung is a really engaging lecturer who truly has a skill in information delivery. It's so easy to pay attention in her class because the content, supplemental material, and Prof. Chung's occasional references to her personal experiences as a clinician are all very relevant to the lecture. <br>That being said, this class is relatively difficult. 2 exams and 2 papers. I started the papers two weeks before the deadline so that I could go to office hours if I ran into issues; this really helped my grade because the grading is pretty strict.",
                    "22": "Professor Chung is truly amazing and very kind. She really wants her students to learn. However, the class was a lot of reading. I would highly recommend going to office hours.",
                    "23": "prof levy chung is amazing and so interesting. this class is a lot of reading that you must read to do well on exams, but it was worth it and class lectures were super interesting if you have any interest in clinical psychology i cant recommend it enough",
                    "24": "Great class very insightful, but it was a lot of textbook reading that you needed to know for the multiple choice. Prof. Chung is fantastic, very knowledgeable, and makes the class fun and interesting.",
                    "25": "I learned about some of the main theoretical schools in clinical psychology and how they function in practice. The course content was interesting and I thought Professor Chung was very engaging and clear. The class is generally very fair and manageable, but the final paper was a little challenging.",
                    "26": "Prof. Chung is a great lecturer and a kind person. I found this course really interesting, but I want to go into clinical psychology so I'm probably a bit biased. 2 exams and 2 papers, and it seemed like a lot of reading at first but you can definitely skim.",
                    "27": "Professor Levy–Chung is a great, incredibly knowledgeable professor, and has a ton of interesting insight from her own clinical practice that she references in class to explain course material. She is very available to students and condenses a lot of information to make it understandable and applicable within the realm of the class. This is a really good overview/intro course for those interested in being any sort of clinical psych practitioner."

She's super accomplished in the field of psychology and just an amazing professor and person. All of her research and her personal anecdotes and stories made an impact on me. I went into this class with low expectations because I didn't think I would resonate with the content, but I really enjoyed it. It's almost set up like a SESP class, focusing on discussion and peers talking to and teaching each other. This course changed my perspective on a lot of different concepts, and I genuinely think it has made me a better thinker and more enlightened. It really places an emphasis on invisible social groups and issues. Take this class (or just any class!) with Professor Fryberg!",

                    "7": "This class is rooted in cultural psych theories and is super informative with lots on insightful readings/course materials. Stephanie has so much compassion when she teaches and is such a personable professor.  The class felt like a little family. I liked the fact that it only met once a week (though the block is 4hrs long) and it didn't feel as long because of the mixture of lecture, group discussion, and a bunch of hands–on/interactive activities. There are two major assignments (a paper and a final group paper/project) that she grades generously; it's definitely the type of class where you don't necessarily have to put in a bunch of effort for an A, but she doesn't reward low quality work either.",
                    "8": "Overall an amazing class, though I didn’t learn anything past the second lecture. Steph is a great professor: kind, sweet, genuine, patient, and knowledgeable. Given that she was flying in and out every week to teach, she was stretched very thin, where I felt like the last few lectures were just students talking to kill time.<br><br>There were many classes where Steph were just deconstructing students with our consent. It was truly a therapy session for the students at some point and a coffee  hat at other times.<br><br>One group paper, one group presentation, one additional short paper, plus weekly discussion questions. Super super easy A.",
                    "9": "Take this class! As an aspiring physician, I learned so much in this class and it really forced me to think differently about previous takes I had on cultural issues in medicine. It also made me a better writer and I like to think a better future doctor that will really care about the background and struggles of every individual patient. The best part of this class, however, was Dr. Fryberg. Having a really caring professor like this was really incredible, and really drove my interest in this class even despite external struggles. Dr. Fryberg, despite her expansive expertise and education, was also SO, SO sweet and always ready to help. She was so helpful in how and what exactly I could improve for my final paper, and really inspired me to take up a psychology minor after this class as well as join her research lab. Such a caring and sweet professor and I will 100% recommend trying to take this class with her as I really believe you will learn so much more in class and really care about what is being taught.",

                    "3": "Overall a good class! Bodenhausen is an engaging lecturer and passionate about the topic. Two exams and a two part paper, which can feel a bit overkill but both definitely help solidify the material in different ways. You can do well on the exams without doing the reading as long as you study the lecture material well–mostly just memorization.",

Honestly, Professor Bodenhausen is a pretty dry lecturer, but he communicates the material really well, especially since part of it comes from his own research, and he's able to answer questions about any of it clearly. You definitely have to take notes in class, as the lecture slides don't go into the material in much depth. You also don't really need to read the textbook aside from looking over the definitions in the assigned chapters for exams. There are two exams, and it's pretty easy to do well on them as long as you review the material beforehand. There are also two papers, one that is 4–6 pages long and another that is 8–10 pages long. They take a lot of time to finish, but they're not that hard to complete, and the grading is fair. Overall, I would recommend taking this course, especially for psychology majors!",
                    "6": "This class is okay. It's straightforward but honestly really boring– basically just going through the slides each class with not a lot of variety (concept, then a few research studies, over and over). The exams are also difficult but not too difficult. You'll get a B if you study but sometimes there's just a few random things you didn't study and you're screwed. Otherwise, solid course. Bodenhausen and the TA were very nice.",

I'd say the class has a low stress environment, with only two exams and two papers. Exams are definitions, multiple choice, short answer, and one 15–point question. You don't have to read the textbook, although you might want to flick through the bolded key terms in the assigned chapters because he threw in one on the midterms. Overall, I highly recommend this class!",
                    "13": "This class consists of basically 4 assignments (2 tests and 2 papers) so if you don't do well on one of those things it can tank your grade fairly fast. The content was interesting, however, the lectures were incredibly boring. I recommend this class if you want to learn a lot about attitudes but if not I would recommend taking a different psych class.",
                    "14": "Exams are pretty straightforward but there is a lot of content to memorize/understand. You don't have to do the readings. There are 2 papers and 2 exams that roll around at the same time as the other so it's kind of a lot during midterm and finals but it's manageable. Lecture is very organized which I appreciated. Bodenhausen is very knowledgeable and kind."

Material itself is not difficult, although keeping up with all the readings is a bit harder. All 3 exams (no final) were mostly based on lecture, although they always had 3–4 questions from the readings.",
                    "1": "Amazing class. Amazing professor. THE BEST professor I  have had at this school",
                    "2": "This is a very informational course and I like how Professor Finkel used many pop culture and film references while lecturing; he is a very engaging lecturer. However, when it comes down to exam time, it can be a lot to attempt to memorize all the material from lectures and assigned readings. Also, numerous questions can be worded ambiguously and make it more complicated to get the right answer. Fortunately, there are some extra credit opportunities and the exams are curved from the highest grade in the class, but even then it is a bit stressful and challenging trying to do well. With that said, you will need to get ready to take in and consistently actively memorize and study the information as you go. Overall, it is an okay course: very engaging material and lecturer, just kind of a tough evaluation method.",
                    "3": "Eli Finkel has to be one of the best professors at Northwestern. The course was super interesting, and he was such a great lecturer. We laughed a lot and learned a lot. My one very minor critique is that every once in a while, Prof Finkel would mess up the explanation of a study during the lecture. For example, he'd say the conclusion from a study was one thing  when it was actually the opposite. The good thing was that every time this happened (maybe a few times throughout the course), he would just scrap that one little topic from the exam. There's three midterms, the first being the hardest mainly because people underestimate how much stuff you have to remember. So if you want a good grade, actually do the readings and review slides. Office hours with Erin Hughes were very helpful. 60 question multiple choice can trip you up for sure, but don't get discouraged if you do poorly on one of them. I had an 8 point improvement from my first to second midterm after realizing I needed to do more review. Extra credit is also super easy and helps your grade A LOT (one exam percentage point increase per, and there's 4 extra credit assignments).",
                    "4": "Of all the Northwestern courses, this one is a MUST–TAKE. Finkel is the absolute BEST professor in the world and he made his office hours such a fun and engaging environment every time!! The lectures were well–organized and the combination with pop culture references made it all that more engaging. While this is a 300+ person lecture and it's often hard to form a connection with the professor, Finkel was one of the most down–to–earth and easygoing professors I have ever had, and I loved every second I could learn from him. Relationship Science is a relatively unique field and so worth it!!!",
                    "5": "Eli Finkel was borderline misogynistic and problematic a lot of the time. The majority of the crowd was male or so used to the patriarchy that they just laughed along with his heteronormative, white–centered content day–in and day–out. There was one single \"minority\" day, taught by a guest lecturer. As the quarter progressed, he felt more and more at liberty to laugh about very problematic studies, such as the one he conducted in his own lab watching college kids make–out with each other on camera from his office and only telling them that he was recording them after the fact. He was way out of touch with today's norms, yet he desperately attempted to convince us that he was with his irrelevant use of \"gen Z slang\". If you're, for whatever reason, able to sit through this and not feel some type of terrible, uncomfortable way, then I guess take this class if you absolutely have to. Do not take this class if you have any faith in humanity, if you don't want to be depressed every day, or if you care about the advancement of any other demographic besides the white, \"upper–middle class\" (he literally makes thousands of dollars off his students every year by making them buy his book for class), heterosexual male.",
                    "6": "I loved this course. I learned so much and felt like it wasn't that hard regardless.",

                    "8": "Fun course but tests were hard",
                    "9": "I loved this class! Every lecture was so interesting and the professor was very engaging with the material but using clips from movies/tv shows as examples. I genuinely learned a lot from the course and will definitely apply this in my relationships in the future. The tests aren't bad and basically common sense but make sure to thoroughly take notes on all the readings to do well.",
                    "10": "Definitely do the readings – the exams ask a LOT of questions about them, like about 50% of the exam is not covered in lecture I would say.  But Finkle is great! He's super apraochable but also very knowledgable and a great lecturer. <br><br>ALSO with exams – IMO they tend to be more difficult overall than most other psych classes.",
                    "11": "BEST CLASS AT NU TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT!! just 3 exams (if you do the reading and review, you will be fine but you must do the reading) and some opportunities for extra credit along the way. finkel is incredible and i loved going to each class",
                    "12": "I LOVED this class, it was one of the most engaging classes i’ve taken at Northwestern. To put it into perspective, it filled up tech auditorium and continued to fill it up throughout the entire quarter. I truly enjoyed going to class and I learned things that i could apply to my own life and relationships.",
                    "13": "The best thing about this class is the content. I may be biased because I love love and I love science, and these two passions get to come together in this fantastic class. Anyone could get some valuable info out of it, I definitely plan to keep the things I learned in mind when approaching my relationships. A is very achievable, make sure you READ though. Lot of info can be gained from the texts, sometimes even info not mentioned in lecture (that shows up on the exams)!!",
                    "14": "I love the professor. He is very engaging and really helps us understand the material through outside films and videos. Felt like I got a better understanding of how relationships work through psychological studies and real life scenarios. It definitely is not an easy class since there are 3 exams that test your knowledge of lecture content and outside readings. Take the class if you're interested and okay with a more difficult class.",
                    "15": "Excellent distro! Not overly difficult, lectures are fun, Prof. Finkel is awesome! I super recommend!",
                    "16": "Highly recommend taking this course. The content is very interesting, and Prof. Finkle is great at engaging the class. For exams, make sure you study the readings and the experiments mentioned in lecture.",
                    "17": "I really enjoyed this course and Professor Finkel is engaging and passionate, but there was still not enough focus on queer and nonwhite relationships although he acknowledged the lack of research on it in the field. There is one class of a \"diversity\" lecture with info that I would just suggest incorporating into relevant lectures.  Exams are tricky and you need to do the readings.",
                    "18": "THE BEST CLASS I HAVE TAKEN AT NORTHWESTERN! TAKE THIS CLASS! Eli Finkle is hilarious. The lectures are sooo engaging; I wanted to go to class. There is outside reading that NEEDS to be done in order to be successful on the exams, but if you prioritize your time well it should be alright. I highly recommend this class though. Take it if you have the space in your schedule!",
                    "19": "Best professor ever. Course material and tests were hard, but it was a fun class!",
                    "20": "Favorite class of the quarter. Found the topics very engaging and Eli was a great instructor who incorporates a lot of film/TV show clips to represent certain topics. Takes a lot of work to get an A though – the assigned readings add up and will definitely appear on the exams even if the material was not touched in class. As long as you do them, the exams are manageable.",
                    "21": "This is hands–down the best course I have taken at Northwestern! Professor Finkel has so much enthusiasm for relationship science and his lectures were always something to look forward to. I especially enjoyed the many movie clips used to present lecture content. However,  I must admit that there is quite a bit of reading in this class, which is required to do well on the midterms. The 3 midterms were graded fairly, but they could be a little tricky at times. There are 3 extra credit opportunities, though, which are very helpful.",
                    "22": "Loved this course! Eli was great and the class was a ton of fun. You learn a lot about the nature of romantic relationships. A TON of reading is assigned but it's generally pretty interesting. I think the exams were graded fairly, but some of my peers said they didn't do as well on the exams.",
                    "23": "I loved this class!! It's a super engaging course with an amazingly funny professor about topics that are genuinely interesting. I think it was wonderfully well done. You didn't even notice the time going by so quickly because the class moves at a quick yet engaging pace that always makes sure you're paying attention and listening. If you can, you really really should take this class.",
                    "24": "Great class! My only issue was that the exams were a bit of a mess when it came to clarity of questions. It felt as though the test questions didn't allow for nuance the way that class discussions and the readings did. It was really frustrating to have to ask so many questions about what the questions were saying (not j me, the TAs were running around trying to get to everyone during the exam). <br><br>Nevertheless this class was really great and a lot of fun! Finkel is a great lecturer and he would often show videos in class to demonstrate concepts which was super helpful for remembering things long term. The class also provides an opportunity for anyone to learn in a way that can improve their relationships, even though much of the research is on straight white people (im lesbian and latine but still got a lot from it). I highly recommend this class, just be prepared to do some reading.",
                    "25": "Great class. Easy A. I recommend you show up to lecture, they are very engaging and fun anyways (except for like 1–2 about that were on boring topics). Can get away with not doing textbook readings but do the other ones. Love the professor!!",
                    "26": "This class is the absolute coolest. Favorite class at nu – the lectures are so interesting, finkel is the besttt professor, the exams are fair, and the readings outside of class aren't overwhelming. Other than the 3 exams, it's just readings but nothing else is graded.",
                    "27": "This was a great class. Professor Finkel is incredibly well versed in the material and makes lecture interesting and entertaining. The exams can be a little challenging, and if you want an A you definitely have to do the readings.  The class itself has a lot of great information infused within it and its definitely useful for understanding current and future relationships.",
                    "28": "Loved this class! It's huge –&nbsp;100s of people, so don't expect a personalized experience in any way. You can get away with not doing any work most weeks, but you do have to cram during the exam weeks (3 over quarter, make up your whole course grade). The exams are fine if you study well, but they do require you to do the readings outside of class and apply your knowledge to hypothetical situations. Professor Finkel is an extremely engaging lecturer and very respected in the field of relationship science. You won't have a problem paying attention in lecture – we watch tons of clips from rom–coms to dissect relationship phenomena! Definitely don't take this class if you're uncomfortable talking about the science of sex LOL",
                    "29": "This class was really interesting and funny. I felt like excited to go to class every week. The readings were necessary to do well on exams but it’s not too hard to get through them.",
                    "30": "I liked this class and would recommend it if you are a psych major/minor since its a chill 300 level class! Prof. Finkel's lectures were great. Three exams that make up your entire grade (plus like a few extra credit points) which is a bit frustrating because the exams aren't exactly the easiest but they are manageable.  My only concern was when questions were worded a bit confusingly.",
                    "31": "I enjoyed this class, however I do wish that there were more opportunities for evaluation for this course, especially given how much content is taught for this class. Having 3 exams be the only form of evaluation was difficult, especially because the tests are all multiple choice, so there isn't room for partial credit in the exams. I thought the lectures were very engaging, surprisingly so for such a huge lecture. Professor Finkel's lectures were very interesting to listen to because he always provides relevant movies/shows to demonstrate some of the relationship dynamics he teaches about. Overall, I am happy I took this class, and I learned a lot, I just wish there were more ways to be graded (quizzes, more than 3 tests, etc.)",
                    "32": "Really awesome class. Not much work outside of exams however, only grades are 3 exams. Exams  require a decent amount of studying and aren't easy.",
                    "33": "Professor Finkel is one of the best lecturers at NU and covers a lot of ground very well. The exams are challenging and you need to do the readings for them, which is a decent amount for a psych class",
                    "34": "This is a great class. The professor is a great lecturer and all the content is applicable to your own life.",
                    "35": "Fun professor, every class was a blast. Professor has humor and I appreciate the content he prepared.",
                    "36": "very interesting, definitely some readings to do. lectures are fun and educational",
                    "37": "I wanted to take this class to learn because I was really interested in the topic even though I knew it is known for having a lot of material and hard exams. I went to class everyday and sat in the front. I did not look at any of the readings. I scored exactly average on every exam (idk about the final but that was rough because of other reasons). Every exam has around 6ish questions from the readings. If you dont do the readings, you probably wont get an A in the class. A B though if you can memorize whats on the slides, is very doable.",
                    "38": "This is a super unique and interesting class. I will say, as someone who was taking it for fun, it is a little harder than I would hope, but still a great class.",
                    "39": "Finkel's a terrific professor. Wish it wasn't all exams and wish this class was smaller to discuss concepts, because they were really interesting",
                    "40": "I really enjoyed this course! The content was easy to understand, and the lectures were informative and also entertaining. I enjoyed the use of videos to explain things that happen in relationships, and the way the slides were organized made it easy to make flashcards for the exams. The exam questions were, for the most part, fair, but I recommend going back to the readings, especially in the marriage book and the textbook, and making flashcards for that on top of the stuff from class. I found that flashcards were the best way to study for these exams.",
                    "41": "not an easy class by any means. exams were challenging and there was an immense amount of material for each. Finkel incredibly engaging, but lots of the readings were redundant and questions would be poorly written/nitpicky.",
                    "42": "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! This was truly one of the best classes that I have ever taken at Northwestern, and I could not encourage you more to take it. The professor was so funny and such a great lecturer, and I always looked forward to going to class. While there was a lot of reading (on average, one chapter from the textbook and one chapter from his marriage book per day), they were super interesting as well and easy to read, except for some of the journal articles. There were no assignments other than three non–cumulative exams, and they were honestly pretty easy/doable, especially if you have taken psych exams before. They also offered 3–4 points total of extra credit for a simple reflection assignment before each exam and curved the tests, so it wasn't hard to do well.<br><br>Even though I have taken like 8 psychology classes before, this was probably the one that was the most relevant to everyday life. We talked about attraction, attachment, aggression, how to improve relationships, and more. I learned so much from this course, and I'm sure I'll be looking back at my notes in the future to try to make my relationships better haha. Again, please take this class if you can; you won't regret it!",
                    "43": "This class was super fun! The midterms were hard though",
                    "44": "THIS CLASS IS AMAZING.This is the best class I have taken at northwestern so far.The content is very applicable in real–life and the professor is amazing.I never skipped class at all because class is so much fun! However, there is a lot of readings for each class. The test is 60 multiple choice questions and can be a little hard if you don't study, but doable with  revision.Overall an easy A– , but harder to get an A.",
                    "45": "This is the best class I've ever taken, Northwestern or otherwise. The content in this course is the most interesting and applicable material you will learn in a class. I learned more about myself and my relationships with other people, romantic and platonic. Some studies that we looked at in class or in the readings blew my mind with their accuracy and novelty. The only downside to this course is the amount of reading outside of class to be done, but at least there was no other homework besides the reading, and they were very interesting most of the time. The class depends entirely on 3 midterms, which can be stressful because messing up on one of them can decide your entire grade. Eli Finkel is the funniest and best lecturer I've had. Even if you don't need this class for a distro, I would still take it for the experience.",
                    "46": "This course was super fun and engaging. Professor Finkel is a great lecturer and all of the content was super interesting and relevant to life. Tests were not too bad if you study, so definitely make sure to study. Readings could get a little long, but all manageable if you make the time for them or split them up. Overall, great course, would highly recommend!",
                    "47": "This course is a great elective to take. It isn't difficult at all. 3 exams worth 1/3 of your grade each and they are not cumulative. Exams are multiple choice as well. I found it was pretty easy to just pay attention in lecture to do very well on the exams. If you do all the readings it is nearly impossible to get less than a 90 on the exams. Lectures are really great and interesting, but honestly the content isn't very surprising. Every concept is pretty expected and straightforward. For example, you will learn that creative people are more passionate in their relationships. It's interesting, but did you expect anything else? Take this course to have fun and experience great lectures and teaching. It is a pretty easy A as well if you do the minimum readings",
                    "48": "There is a reason why this class is so popular, Professor Finkel is amazing. He is very funny charismatic and passionate about the course and the exams (which are 100% of the grade) are really not that bad so long as you study and utilize the widely available quizlets online.",
                    "49": "I learned SO MUCH about relationships! The clips of pop culture, films, media, etc really helped exemplify the concepts and helped me understand. Relationship attachment styles, stressors, intimacy enhancement, aptitude vs compatibility, communication, conflict and resolution, different phases of a relationship, growth vs destiny mindsets, etc. It was a lot of information to memorize, especially since class lectures, Prof Eli Finkel’s marriage book, textbook, and other supplemental readings were fair game on exams, which made them pretty difficult and it’s unfortunate that the class was only 3 unit exams and some extra credit, so not an easy A–/A… but truly a fun and valuable class! Also I really appreciated the inclusion of some LGBTQIA+ diversity data and insight from Emma’s guest lecture. It is probably not acknowledged enough that much of the (relationship) psych data has overrepresentation of WEIRD (white, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic) and white hetero american women. Would be more interesting to be more inclusive of non–hetero relationships.",
                    "50": "I loved this course!! Probably my favorite class I’ve taken at Northwestern. The material is so interesting and applicable to your own life and Professor Finkel is awesome.",
                    "51": "Highly recommend this class! Professor Finkel is an interesting and charismatic lecturer. If you are interested in romance or rom–coms at all, you will enjoy this course. If you do the readings and know the content for the lectures exams are not too bad. Also, a good class to take with a friend!",
                    "52": "This class is amazing. Finkel does an amazing job of engaging with the entire lecture hall and using modern examples to explain confusing concepts. The exams are much more confusing than the TA's make it out to be and a lot of the times you get stuck on questions. To succeed in this class you need to pay attention in class and do all the readings.",
                    "53": "Good distro class, the lectures are interesting and prof. Finkel is super funny and engaging. Class grade consists of 3 exams and an extra credit opportunity. The class has a surprising amount of reading, but you can get by just skimming.",
                    "54": "This class was great! The grade is entirely based on 3 multiple choice exams which is nice because there was very little work for the class besides attending lecture and looking over readings before exams. I would not say this class is an easy A though. The content is fascinating, Finkel is very accomplished and an amazing, entertaining lecturer. Learned a lot that applies to real life.",
                    "55": "TAKE. THIS. CLASS. Finkel is the unequivocal goat. Lectures are super interesting, using a combination of explanations, study results, and movie clips showing how the concepts we learn work out in \"the real world.\"  There are quite a few readings, and tests aren't something you can just show up to and do well on – you really have to do the readings, even just going to lectures isn't enough. But you can get by skipping a few or cramming :) Most of the readings are enjoyable though, and if you're at all interested in the psychology of relationships, you will love this class.",
                    "56": "It's a decent class, the material itself is not difficult but the exam questions can sometimes be a bit unnecessarily detailed. The class has 3 midterms, all MCQ and there are extra credit questions.",
                    "57": "It was very fun and interesting.",
                    "58": "If you're looking for an easy distro this is a great option: engaging lectures, slides are posted, and the only graded component is 3 multiple choice exams (not cumulative, and no final during finals week); however, the professor can be a bit crass, so if that gets on your nerves I would highly consider going a different route. If you are a psych major/minor looking for a good psych class, would not recommend. Way too many of the course readings are the professor's own research (you have to buy/read the book he wrote + articles) so you don't get really any other perspectives from the field. Additionally, all the research presented comes from samples that are predominately white college students and then these samples are used to make generalize about the entire world; the professor also really doesn't admit to the limitations of the research. If you're interested in this topic and want to encounter solid research I would take Social Psychology over this; it covers this info and more and has much more nuanced perspectives.",
                    "59": "Professor is a funny dude and I highly recommend this as a distro. Not because its an obvious easy A but the material is so easy to relate to and reflect on so it makes the learning process wayyyy more accessible IMO. Also if you're in a relationship situationship whatever its like personal therapy every lecture and is great for your own personal development as a human in some ways! That being said you actually have to do all the readings  at least skimming and go to class but not bad . ALl of the material is relatively common sense.",
                    "60": "I really enjoyed this class. Professor Finkel makes class engaging and made me more interested in the material.",
                    "61": "This class was shockingly patriarchal, heteronormative, and Eurocentric. Every piece of content that didn't have to do with straight white couples was pushed into a single lecture titled \"diversity.\" This was a complete shame for a Northwestern class––the psychology department needs to do better.<br><br>3 exams (33% x3). This class isn't hard, but you absolutely cannot get an A without doing readings. Only about half of the test content is covered in lecture, which is really stupid given that about half of lecture time was spent goofing around. But there's some interesting stuff and Eli's nice.",
                    "62": "AMAZING course. Prof Finkel is a great lecturer and keeps you engaged for the entire 80 minutes. If you have any interest in the class, take it. Only work is 3 midterm exams which are not easy but as long as you do the readings and study you should be fine. We also had an incredibly easy extra credit opportunity that allowed for us to get up to 4 whole percentage points added to our final grade (not sure if this particular extra credit will stay the same since it was for a study the prof was conducting).",
                    "63": "I enjoyed this class a lot more than I expected! Going in not really being too interested in psychology, this course opened my eyes to the interesting work and applications being done not only in this field, but in a lot of psychology as well. Lectures really were very engaging yet also informative –&nbsp;the examples and videos shown to exemplify the concepts were all chosen quite well, and not only made lecture fun but also informative. I think that the readings also did a good job of complementing the lecture content –&nbsp;sometimes it felt a little bit redundant, but that was not a huge factor. Exams were also very fair in my opinion. I really liked this class! &lt;3",
                    "64": "This class is so illuminating! Genuinely changed my life lol, really interesting and Professor Finkel is super funny and a great lecturer! Take this class!!",
                    "65": "Take this class! The content is so interesting and prof fink definitely tries to make it relevant to college students. I genuinely learned so much and enjoyed going to class. Only 3 multiple choice midterms but they are kind of challenging. You do actually have to do the readings and listen in class if you want to do well",
                    "66": "I really liked this class!! It's so interesting and will make you see relationships in a different light. Professor Finkel is also an amazing lecturer who definitely knows his stuff. The readings are really long and annoying to do, but you need to do them for the exams. I found the exams pretty challenging though. But regardless, TAKE THIS CLASS.",
                    "67": "This course is a fun one and I would recommend it, but it was super frustrating that all relationship science experiments and studies were on white straight people. As a queer person at Northwestern I expected better, and I didn't learn much at all that applied to me personally which was very frustrating.",
                    "68": "GREAT CLASS! Definitely take it if you have a chance. You'll learn so much interesting stuff that's actually applicable to everyday life. Probably one of the most influential classes I've taken at NU. The exams are hard to do well on, though, and you definitely need to study a lot for them. Prof Finkel is absolutely awesome.",
                    "69": "This was a very interesting course and the information was fun to learn! The exams are a bit tricky and would be impossible to do well on without keeping up with the readings and lecture. This is a large lecture and Prof. Finkel does not make himself super available to the students (office hours for two hours and not open to email) so if you need any assistance you work closely with the TAs.",
                    "70": "Best class I’ve taken at NU. Content is relevant and interesting, only 3 exams that are very fair with averages of 87.",
                    "71": "My ONLY but HUUUUGE issue with this class is that it's SO CLEARLY made–by–a–straight–white–man and made–for–other–straight–white–men. Queer relationships were a total afterthought, and it seemed funny to me that there were more same sex couples described in hypothetical test questions than actually talked about in–class (again, serving afterthought).  I also think that this class could've benefited a lot more from a feminist perspective, as certain comments rubbed me the wrong way (e.g. saying Incels are \"a little misogynistic\" was a bit of a slap in the face to any woman who's ever had the displeasure of meeting one lmao), and we never really got into the power dynamics of straight relationships much. <br><br>Certain ideas in this class generally struck me as the recipe for making a good relationship ~for him~ rather than considering the ways in which heterosexual relationships may still be unequal thanks to implicit misogyny – for instance, I wholeheartedly reject the idea promoted in this class that \"spouses should be willing to have sex for the benefit of the other partner even when they may not want to\" ––  it's basically shorthand for \"**women** should be willing to have sex for the benefit of **men** even when they may not want to\" (particularly given how much this class emphasizes how important sex is for men compared to women, like are we not supposed to put 2 and 2 together here...?). It's frankly disturbing to see this prescriptive idea perpetuated by an authority figure when just about every women I know has been coerced into having sex by a male partner within the context of an intimate, romantic relationship on at least one occasion.  I personally still had a good time taking this course, and it was very low–stress and manageable. Just really wish the straight white guy at the front of the room drew from intersectional ideas and perspectives, because women and queer people are NOT the key demographic of this course.",
                    "72": "The professor is funny so the lectures aren't boring, but the class material is really redundant and I didn't really learn anything about relationships. You pretty much just learn a bunch of statistics/parameters about the US population.  I would recommend if you want an easy, fun class, but would not recommend if you actually want to learn about psychology.",
                    "73": "This course is incredibly interesting. Professor Finkel is engaging and every class flies by. The material is easy to connect with and the book is also fun to read for class. The tests aren't too bad, although you do need to read for them.",
                    "74": "GREAT professor, so funny and charismatic. Sometime got lost when explaining more specific aspects of his research rather than the thoeries themselves",
                    "75": "awesome class. surprisingly longish readings. recommend taking it pass fail but still doing the readings to get more out of it. also take it with friends, makes it so much more fun! professor finkel just gives such fun lectures it was so enjoyable to go to class ––– definitely a bucket list class!!!!!!",
                    "76": "This class was honestly the most entertaining topic and Professor Finkel is a great lecturer. I really enjoyed going to class. I would recommend checking canvas before the first day of class and to read all the readings even if they seem unimportant. DO THE EXTRA CREDIT and study for the exams, it is not common sense.",
                    "77": "This class is a MUST TAKE. The material we learned was super interesting, and it will definitely stick with me in the future. We did have a lot of readings to do before class (textbook readings, readings from the professor's own book, and occasionally readings on Canvas), but the grading came down to three exams. I wish there were more opportunities for extra credit to bump our grades up though. Overall, the class material is super interesting and will definitely make you psychoanalyze your relationships.",
                    "78": "I am a firm believer that this class is not as good as people say it is. You have to read the textbook (including Finkel's own book) to do well on exams which is frustrating because a fair portion of lecture is spent watching videos instead of going over material, which is engaging but would make more sense to me to have the optional activity (video watching) happen outside of class and the required activity (learning) happening in class. Most of the results presented are not very convincing, but the second eli finkel sees a p value less than 0.05 he seems to accept that as the word of god. Y axes are also regularly scaled to make effect sizes look larger than they actually are, and data presented in lecture is rarely cited so students are unable to draw their own conclusions about what study results mean–– we instead have to memorize the conclusions that the study conductors came to, and regurgitate those answers on exams. Relationships were definitely a big part of this class. Science, less so.",
                    "79": "I really like this class! It's very chill, only 3 exams for the whole quarter.  The exams are multiple choice and not bad but not easy. The prof makes the content very fun and enjoyable, and he puts video and movie clips to make the content more relatable.  There is a lot of reading for this class though, and I would say the reading is important for the exams. However, you learn a lot from this class that you can use in your life.",
                    "80": "This class is an easy distro, a great major/minor req, or even just a fun class to take in general. Prof. Finkel is a great lecturer, both entertaining and informative. The class only has 3 non–cumulative exams and ends before reading week, so the workload is not bad either – take it if you can.",
                    "81": "This is an amazing class that everyone should take. Professor Finkel is one of the greatest lecturers I've had at NU –– he's so interesting, funny, and gives the information in the best way. The only downside to the class is the reading –– there's a TON, and you need to do it for the tests (which are pretty hard). It's a class that's absolutely worth taking, but the readings do take more time than you want them to.",
                    "82": "This class was not as as hard as the people last year said it would be. Just make sure to read the readings and pay attention in class, and you will be fine. Prof Finkel is really great: a movie and TV show connoisseur, funny and engaging with his use of video clips in lecture slides.. All in all, definitely recommend this class",
                    "83": "It was a pretty fun class BUT kinda overrated if you are looking for a lot of scientific psych explanation. I feel like I had fun listening to interesting theories but really had a hard time compelled by them….",
                    "84": "Interesting topics, enjoyed going to class. Keep up on material it goes fast and exams test you on a lot",
                    "85": "Took this class for fun and it met my expectations. Super interesting content and lectures, made me excited to attend lecture. Make sure to do the readings for the exams, which are relatively straightforward. 3 exams, class ends before finals week.",
                    "86": "A fun class, the professor is great.",
                    "87": "Very interesting course content, but if you want to do well be prepared to read and study a LOT. Entire grade consists of 3 exams, nothing else. Exams are definitely challenging.",
                    "88": "The course is a lot of reading, but if you keep up roughly within the five class segments (three midterms, each after five classes noncumulative), then it isn't too hard to prepare for the midterms. You can learn a lot and Prof. Finkel makes the lectures entertaining.",
                    "89": "Professor Finkel is the best part of this class without a doubt. Such a charismatic guy, at first what seems like a long lecture is made short with him. The cntent is interesting as well, great learning about all the studies especially those conducted on campus.",
                    "90": "This class was so much fun! While the material and research did skew very heavily toward cishet couples (why that is the case was talked about in class), I thought the lecture content was very interesting and felt relevant to how I view all of my close relationships, not just romantic ones. Eli makes lectures engaging and relatable, frequently using movies and reality TV clips to demonstrate a concept he just talked about. This is probably one of the best psych courses I have taken at Northwestern and the barrier to entry to get something useful out of the class is so low that I often invited my friends to come to lectures and they would have a great time. There are three exams, all multiple–choice. It is pretty doable, just make sure to do all the assigned readings as there may be a sizable amount of questions dedicated to them that are not covered through lectures. Aside from that, I had very little work outside of class. Overall, this is a great class to fulfill a requirement or just take for fun!",
                    "91": "Definitely a very interesting class, but requires work.  there's a good amount of readings every class and you need to do them and know them for the exam. Great class overall though. Interesting topic and the professor is very engaging",
                    "92": "This was one of the best courses I have taken at Northwestern. The concepts are extremely interesting ranging from attraction to love to conflict to improving relationships. This professor is an amazing lecturer, he is super engaging, using clips from various movies/shows to illustrate concepts, is funny and communicates very clearly. I have never seen a class of 400 people so engaged in a course before. The lectures are the best part but the exams, not so much. There are 3 non–cumulative midterms and no final, each midterm covering a different section of the course. The midterms are very challenging, they consist of questions from both the lectures and specifics from the readings so you actually have to thoroughly read. However, I think it is worth taking regardless because it is a great class overall, and it is nice to end early without any final.",
                    "93": "This is an amazing class!!! I will say, I would not call this an easy A. The class is composed of just two midterms and a final, each of which makes up 1/3 of your grade, which can make it hard to do well if you do poorly on even just one of the tests. However, in my opinion, the grading situation is completely worth it for the quality of the class. Professor Finkel is incredible, and I have never seen Tech Auditorium so full. There never seemed to be a drop off in attendance because people were actually so invested in it. He is so funny and incorporates TV shows like Love Island and Friends into the lessons to demonstrate the material. I literally felt like I was watching stand up comedy sometimes. I genuinely learned so much in this course and I was sad when it ended. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!",
                    "94": "The best class I've ever taken at NU. HE's such a good lecturer and so engaging. all the concepts apply to everyday life and its so digestible to learn. however I did not great on the tests so definitely do closer readings",
                    "95": "Possibly the most interesting class I have ever taken. Readings are long but there is no other homework so it balances out. You need to do the readings in order to do well in the course. Also make sure you do the extra credit. TAKE THIS CLASS!",
                    "96": "Not an incredibly easy A if you're taking as a distro, the exams can be pretty hard and require you to know a lot from the readings and the lectures (readings can cover content not in the lectures that will be on the exams). Very reading heavy course, you're expected to read a few chapters from the textbook and the professor's own book or some other material before each class, and if you don't you basically have to cram them in some time before the exam because all the material is free to be on the exam. I'd say the actual content is pretty common sense, kind of just putting a name onto things you might already know, but some things are pretty specific so the exams can be tricky.",
                    "97": "The course consists of 3 exams, with an extra credit opportunity before each exam. Prof. Finkel is the best professor I've had during my 3 years at Northwestern, and I've already had a number of amazing professors in the psych department. Prof. Finkel is genuinely so passionate about the topic, and he uses his own experiences and book to illustrate many of the points he is teaching about. His lectures are extremely well–organized, well–timed, and well–presented, and he also answers many questions during class. You do definitely still have to do a decent amount of reading of the textbook and Prof. Finkel's marriage book, but as long as you put in some work, take notes, and study for a bit, it's not hard to get a good grade (especially with the extra credit!). This was probably my favorite class I've taken at this school, and I definitely recommend you take this class if you're interested in learning about relationship science, regardless of what your school/major is.",
                    "98": "Topics were all very interesting and came together at the end of the course",
                    "99": "This class is extremely fun, but be warned: tests are extremely confusing, to the point where questions have to be removed in real time because they're impossible to interpret. If you're not hung up on grades and you're willing to accept a C+ to B+ range in exchange for a highly entertaining class with some great life advice, I'd highly recommend. Not great for the GPA but incredible for life skills!",
                    "100": "I cannot emphasize how much I enjoyed this course. Definitely take this. Professor Finkel is so engaging and lively, and the content was so interesting. I looked forward to class every week. No homework for this class other than the weekly readings, which you must do to keep up and do well on exams. Exams are difficult to get an A on, but if you go to lectures and do the readings, you will do well.",
                    "101": "I cannot recommend this course enough. If you have the opportunity to take this class, you MUST.  First, the structure of this class is great. No homework except for weekly readings (which are not crazy long and are also very interesting), and three, equally weighted midterms– no crazy final. While it is a lot of memorization, the course content is SO interesting. Have you dated someone? Do you want to date someone? Did you just break up with someone? Do you know people who are dating? If your answer was yes to any of these questions, you will love this class. This is the one lecture–based class at Northwestern where I actually showed up to every single class and paid attention to every single slide– that's how great it is. Also– Professor Finkel? Amazing. The most interesting and engaging lecturer I've ever had. The way he teaches and bridges theories and studies to modern–day pop–culture examples makes it difficult to not listen. I've told everyone I know and now I'm telling you: take this class. You will not regret it.",
                    "102": "I LOVED THIS CLASS!!!! It was so entertaining, the lectures felt like TED talks. I loved that there were tv show/movie clips tied into the lecture. This class felt very applicable and relevant to my life. I actually declared a psych minor after taking this class. We were only graded on three exams but I felt like the grading was very fair and straight forward. There was even an opportunity for extra credit. TAKE THIS CLASS!!",
                    "103": "Incredibly interesting, super fun, everyone at NU should take it. Exams were kinda hard tho",
                    "104": "Very interesting class. Readings were sometimes a lot to be honest, but still manageable. You have your first exam the third week. Definitely need to review literally everything given/assigned to you to do well on exam.",
                    "105": "This class was a lot of fun and I would definitely recommend it to anyone with any interest in psychology. Prof. Finkel makes it a very engaging class with pop culture references/video clips, and he's also pretty funny and regularly interacts with students. The only assignments for the class are 3 midterms with EC opportunities, and the nice thing is that there's no final, so class ended a lot earlier than most do. There is a lot of reading for the class, but it was interesting to read and if you stay on top of it, it's not too bad.",
                    "106": "Take this class. It's so fun and Finkel is a great lecturer. It's a decent amount of reading but very interesting content.",
                    "107": "Yes, I enjoyed the readings and the lectures. Analyzing the video clips in class was fun, as they helped illustrate the relationship concepts we'd been discussing. This course also helped to clarify why I sometimes felt friction in my own relationship, and has helped me understand how to better improve my relationships. <br>Professor Finkel is an extremely engaging lecturer and communicates his ideas and research clearly.  Sometimes I wish class speed was even faster, as we could fit more content there.",
                    "108": "Finkel is a great lecturer; it feels like watching a TedTalk every class. Super funny and engaging. I learned a lot in the class that was applicable in my life. However, I did not think the exams were well written. The \"correct\" for a lot of questions I missed could not even be explained by the TAs who wrote their questions; a lot of wording was very unclear and I do not think the exams reflect how much I studied the content.",
                    "109": "I enjoyed this course and found the material interesting. I ended up taking is P/N since it didn't count towards my requirements, and since it wasn't as easy to get an A as my friends and I thought it would be. Your entire grade is made up of just 3 exams (multiple choice), the medians for which we're usually about 85–90% even after curves and extra credit, so I wouldn't go in again expecting to get an A without a lot of extra studying.",
                    "110": "I was very pleased with this course because it taught me a lot about my personal love life, as well as relationships in general.",
                    "111": "This is a super interesting class but the amount of reading is kind of crazy for what the class is. No homework, just 3 exams.",
                    "112": "I LOVED this course!!! The lectures are so entertaining, and the professor does an excellent job teaching content and incorporating engaging video materials from shows, movies, etc. I genuinely enjoyed going to class! Warning – the readings are a lot, and you have to do them to do well on the exams. I spent ~8 hours a week taking notes on the various readings, but honestly I did not really mind it because they were so interesting. For the exams, you have to study hard and make sure you have a thorough understanding of all readings and class notes. It is definitely a time consuming process. The exams are 60 MC questions, and although I felt like I had a great understanding of the content, I still sometimes struggled on the questions because some were very specific. There are 3 easy extra credit opportunities that, if you do all of them, can add 4 percentage points to your grade, which was a nice cushion.",
                    "113": "Great class, amazing lectures. Lots of reading––and they do test you on the readings––so make sure to do them each week and honestly, just start a study guide reviewing the class content as you go through the quarter. It makes studying a lot easier since there's so much content to make your study guide as you go through each lecture––otherwise you'll crash and burn. Professor Finkel is an amazing lecturer though, cannot stress that enough, and the class topics are super interesting and applicable to life",
                    "114": "This is such an interesting class to take! Amazing lecturer and amazing slides, but there are a lot of readings that you have to do. If you do them, then an A is definitely possible.",
                    "115": "The course material is easy, the test are just made to REALLY make sure you understand and lowkey try to trip you up sometimes.  I'm REALLY hoping this next test gets curved....",
                    "116": "i loved this course and would absolutely recommend it. the slides were easy to follow and the only grades are the 3 exams which are not super difficult as long as you study,",
                    "117": "Take this class!! This is one of the most interesting and fun classes I have ever taken at Northwestern. Not only is the content incredibly engaging in and of itself, but Finkel is an amazing professor who never fails to make the class laugh at all points throughout lecture. This is one of those classes where you are never bored and that passes by quickly and without dragging. You find yourself looking at the content and applying it to your own life as well. There's only three exams and while they are a bit challenging, it is definitely possible to get an A in the class. If you take this class for nothing else, take it for the amount of times you'll crack up while hearing Finkel teach. It is totally worth it, and everyone, no matter your major, should take it.",
                    "118": "AMAZINGGGGG please take this class! Professor Finkel is an amazing lecturer and as of now, this is the only undergrad course he teaches. Take advantage of office hours and pay attention in class. He is an amazing speaker and truly makes this class special. I learned a lot of great things about relationships and communication. This was my 5th class of the quarter and was not too much extra effort– definitely worth it.",
                    "119": "Such a great class. Eli is such an engaging lecturer and his use of movie/TV clips really helps to understand the concepts. Make sure to do the readings as the exams are not particularly easy. As long as you study and take it seriously, you will be fine.  I truly feel like I learned so much from the class.",
                    "120": "TAKE THIS COURSE!! Definitely not an easy A but course changed my life.  It’s literally like relationship therapy every week. Feels like every class is a TED talk. Never been excited to go  class but I genuinely looked forward to attending class.",
                    "121": "I am now my friends' relationship advisor. It remains to be seen whether the lessons I've learned will help me in my own relationships.",
                    "122": "TAKE THIS CLASS!! This class is such a favorite of mine, I'm genuinely sad that it's over. Prof Davis and all of the TAs are amazing, the readings were pretty interesting (though there is a lot of it), and the lectures were so entertaining. You can tell Prof Davis is into what he's teaching, and his lectures are so funny and engaging. He relates concepts to familiar shows/movies, to our lives, and to his own, so I found all of the concepts to be not only easy to grasp but fun to learn. It's also not hard to do well in this class. Grades are based off of 3 multiple choice exams, with extra credit opportunities for each of them. You kinda need to do some of the reading to do really well on them, but if you understand the lectures you can also just get by with a quick review and common sense. And testing out the theories on your own relationships is a pretty good way to prepare too lol. But seriously take this class. I loved it, and I'm so glad I took it (my bf is too).",
                    "123": "This class was amazing! I loved every part of it. You learn so much, but the class never feels dull. The workload is light, so it felt better learning without the pressure of having to understand every single part of every lecture.",
                    "124": "The professor was just fantastic, very enthusiastic and stimulating. He truly made the class fun and the 80mins bearable. Def take the class. Easy A or A– and there are a lot of extra credit opp.",
                    "125": "I loved this class! Finkel was one of the best professors I've had at Northwestern, and he was super interesting to listen to. He was super engaging and every lecture was so fun to listen to. There was a lot of reading, but it was always interesting and pretty easy to comprehend. The class itself was really great, but the tests were unnecessarily complicated. They are written by the TAs and in my opinion, very poorly written.",
                    "126": "eli is a cool professor, loved this course came to class excited to learn, idea’s communicated quite well, humorous and cool class",
                    "127": "very engaging lecture!",
                    "128": "TAKE THIS CLASS. It is so fun and I enjoyed coming to class. The professor is so nice, and his lectures are all very fun. He does not record lectures, but class is interesting to go to. You have to go to class and do the readings to do well on the exam. Overall, attainable A. There are only 3 exams with pretty much no curve. The averages are around 85. I would still take the class tho it is so good, my favorite class i've taken at northwestern by far.",
                    "129": "super fun class. class time is full of movie clips and laughter. the tests were a little hard but I also never did the reading, so if you dint read and just go off class material you can get a high C or low B in the class overall. Eli is such a silly guy I loved him.",
                    "130": "Pros<br>– This class probably saved my relationship with my partner. Not only did I learn about relationships, I also learnt how to be a better partner. This class should be required for any person who ever wants to be in any sort of relationship. Taking this with my partner has also created lots of common topics for us to reference as we navigate the complexities of a relationship. Overall, this may end up being the most important and life–changing class that I take at NU. Please, take this class if you can.<br>– Finkel may be the best professor I've had at Northwestern. He's definitely the best lecturer I've had. There's a reason why my friends who are not even taking this class regularly attend lectures for fun. Finkel is funny, engaging and effective. Classes are half informative lecturing, half stand up comedy that drives home the concepts. Finkel is also one of the leading researchers in the field, so it's pretty cool seeing him cited in the textbook. I wish more professors at NU were like him honestly.<br>– Class content is always interesting and relevant to daily life. Many of the topics are not things that I would have had a forum to discuss anywhere else, so I really appreciate the chance to explore them in this class. Also, Finkel discusses actionable insights for improving relationships, which I have put into practice in my current relationship.<br><br>Cons<br>– Grading can be tough because your entire grade depends on 3 multiple choice exams, and they had some tricky questions on them. That being said, I definitely could have done better if I had kept up with the readings, so make sure to read the readings!<br>– I wish there was a discussion session so I could talk about class content more, especially talking about how I can apply the content to daily life. That would enhance my learning even more and would probably be an awesome experience",
                    "131": "Very interesting course, very entertaining professor. I didn't need to do the reading because I had friends that helped me with reading specific items, but there are definitely things on the readings not on the lecture notes on the exams. <br>Attendance: Not Mandatory",
                    "132": "I really enjoyed learning about the pros and cons of relationships",
                    "133": "I really enjoyed this class because Finkel is such a great lecturer. Every lecture was very engaging and digestible. A lot of people don't do the readings but I recommend it because even though they aren't really discussed in class, the exams incorporate material from both lecture and the reading. If you study the exams are super doable.  Overall I would really recommend this class even if it has nothing to do with your major.",
                    "134": "This course was awesome. Professor Finkel was such a great professor and every lecture felt like a TED talk. It was so easy to review my notes for the exams because the lectures were so memorable. The class did require you to do all of the readings to really succeed on the exams and there were a lot of readings. The readings were mostly interesting though and the class was interesting as a whole. Your grade is made up of three exam grades and there is an opportunity for a little extra credit. I highly recommend this class.",
                    "135": "The lectures and slides for this class are exceptionally well organized. The lectures were engaging, I enjoyed that Finkel often included video clips from movies and tv shows since it creates a connection from class material to really concrete examples. There are three exams and they are all relatively straightforwad and not cumulative. The textbook was relatively interesting and Finkel's book which is assigned is also pretty good.",
                    "136": "Take this course! Professor Finkel is so engaging and teaches the material in such an interesting manner. I looked forward to attending his classes and the reading material was very interesting. This is definitely one of my favorite classes at NU.",
                    "137": "TAKE THIS CLASS! I had never taken a psych class prior to this, and after taking it, I've decided to take PSYCH 110 next quarter, am interested in getting involved in psych research, and am considering picking up a major or minor in psych. Professor Finkel is probably the best lecturer I have ever had, and he has the most helpful lecture slides. Class is not too difficult. Grades are entirely determined by three, 60 question multiple choice midterms. If you study the night before each one and do the extra credit you'll get a B+ or higher, and if you just stay on top of things getting an A is well within reach. Even if you've never taken a psych class or have just the slightest interest in the subject, this class will engage you and teach you lessons you can apply to your life. Great for a distro or elective. One of the best classes offered at Northwestern. If you're a first–quarter freshman and don't know what to take, take this. One of the best decisions I made in my first quarter at NU.",
                    "138": "HIGHLY RECOMMEND; each class is like a TED talk they are fun and easy to follow. Interesting topics throughout the course. 3 tests non–cumulative MC",
                    "139": "this class is awesome. prof Finkel is super engaging and funny, his lectures are easy to follow and fun, his answers questions well, the tests are harder than you'd expect and there's not any review materials, the readings are really interesting and there's no hw which is nice. some concepts aren't differentiated well enough so its tricky on the exams",
                    "140": "Professor Finkel is a really good lecturer and makes class time interesting and engaging for the most part.  I enjoyed taking the course as a chill and fun psych elective.",
                    "141": "I enjoyed this class so much and thought everything I learned was so important for any relationships. I appreciated the instruction and the enthusiasm that Prof Finkel added to each lecture. I do wish that we would at least go over the most important things we should know from the textbooks in class because there is a lot of information and it was hard to know what from the textbook would be fair game for tests. However, I think office hours are good for this and the TA's were always helpful before tests.",
                    "142": "SOOO much work. While this was a very interesting class, I found the readings to be a lot. There are several chapters of multiple books assigned before each class. The tests are also very nitpicky and difficult. So, while the content of the course is interesting, the class overall is very difficult.",
                    "143": "This class is super interesting–– content is fascinating and Prof Finkel's combination of lecture with the use of video clips / real life examples makes class extremely engaging. That being said, this class covers A LOT of content. Exams are DIFFICULT. I often finished exams feeling that I did pretty well after doing the mountains of readings and studying for days in advance, and am still barely scraping by with a passing grade. The exams aren't exactly tricky, but the sheer amount of content covered in class means that it's almost impossible to feel completely prepared going in. That being said, this is still a super fun and interesting class that will change the way you look at relationships as a whole, and I am glad that I took it.",
                    "144": "The course was great! Every class seemed like a TED talk because the material was very interesting and the Professor was a great lecturer. The exams are mc but they are actually hard, you need to read and study a lot for them.",
                    "145": "This is probably the coolest class I've ever taken. It was my first psychology class, and the amount I learned about relationships and the science behind the way we look at them was super cool. The exams are challenging with the amount of content covered, but the extra credit helps the grading a bit. Would 100% recommend.",
                    "146": "best class of all time. eli is hilarious. you talk and learn about such practical things. readings are a lot and are only hard part on exams tbh. know the important studies. he throws a couple questions on the exams that you wont get unless you guess or know like a little detail from class or something so dont stress too much. 4% added to grade for free. expect a B+. people will complain that the stuff is too biased towards heterosexual couples and he does not do a good enough job incorporating more inclusive stuff. this aint true, there just isnt that much research out there and he includes as much as he can",
                    "147": "This course was incredibly interesting. I really loved it; it has been my favorite class at Northwestern. I learned a lot during the course and Professor Finkel is an incredible lecturer. He really knows how to engage with his students.",
                    "148": "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS COURSE! Prof Finkel is an amazing lecturer and class was always super engaging. The topic itself is already interesting, and while the focus is on romantic relationships, the lecture information can also be applied to other kinds of relationships. The grade being based on only three exams is scary, but everything will be fine so long as you prep and make sure to read the textbook as well as the readings.",
                    "149": "Overall, the course gave me the opportunity to learn something I had never really heard of before. truly fun course to take!",
                    "150": "Very interesting and engaging lectures – you get to learn a lot about relationships and apply them to your life. However the exams are hard (all multiple choice) and the readings are a bit tedious.",
                    "151": "The class is fun but the only three grades are the three exams which is a little challenging",
                    "152": "This class was rly engaging and interesting. There's 3 multiple choice midterms if you want to get an A you have to do the readings. We usually watch short clips from movies/tv shows that really illustrate the concept that he's talking about. The class is mostly focused on romantic relationship and is pretty applicable to daily life.",
                    "153": "Take this course! Amazing lectures and the professor is SO SO good.",
                    "154": "This course was incredible. It was so interesting and Professor Finkle is super engaging. He is truly an amazing professor. Nothing was too difficult. Highly reccomend.",
                    "155": "Really engaging class – 3 tests and interesting, applicable lectures. Do the readings and take notes on lectures and you will do great.",
                    "156": "I really loved each class which taught me so much and engaged me in new topics. Each lecture was interesting and taught me so much.",
                    "157": "I can not recommend this course enough, whether you are a psych major or looking for a distro. This has by far been the best class I've taken at Northwestern, and I absolutely love Professor Finkel's style of teaching. It is not easy to make an 80–minute lecture interesting, but he makes the lectures feel super short with how engaging and entertaining they are at times. You can truly tell that he is an expert in his field, and his enthusiasm makes the class even more enjoyable. In terms of course content, it is super content heavy. There are a lot of topics that he discusses (every single one is interesting), but there are a TON of supplemental textbook/article readings as well as his book that make studying for his exams a lot of work. The exams are not easy, but they are manageable, and the three midterms are the sole things that determine your grade. I loved this class overall, and I wish he taught more classes.",
                    "158": "Grades are based 100% on exams but it is not super hard to do okay on the exams as long as you attend class and study the lectures. If you want to get an A though you have to do all the readings and these reading can be pretty heavy.",
                    "159": "A pretty good class! I think it was not as mind blowing as other CTECS made it out to be, but learned a lot of information that I think I can apply to relationships and even friendships moving forward. I noticed the way I processed emotions or navigated conflict was different because of this class! I think you do have to do the readings and attend class to do well on the midterms, but it's all very fair if you do.",
                    "160": "Seriously sad that I'm not going to be able to sit in this class again next quarter. Time flies when you're there. The readings are really long and you do need to study a good amount to do well in the class. It's also NOT an easy A whatsoever. Your entire grade is based off of three non–cumulative exams and nothing else except for some extra credit. I'd say even an A– is not easy by any means, but if you work hard it's definitely doable. The exams aren't hard, but there's little room for error. That being said, I'm sitting at a B+ borderline of an A– depending on the last exam, but I would recommend this class to anyone and everyone. It is SO worth your time. DO IT!!",
                    "161": "Take this course if you can. This course is one of the best at nu. Finkel is a great lecturer, engaging and interesting. The readings and lectures are interesting to the point you don't even realize it is for a class. There are 3 non cumulative midterms that are not tricky. This class is extremely interesting and fair. Absolutely loved this class",
                    "162": "Was a very fun class and as long as you prepare for the three tests its not too bad",
                    "163": "Absolutely loved everything about this class. 10/10 would recommend even if you are not very interested in social psychology.",
                    "164": "TAKE THIS CLASS TAKE THIS CLASS TAKE THIS CLASS!! Truly the most phenomenal course I've ever taken at Northwestern. Not only is the material so interesting and relevant (exploring the complexities of romantic relationships is SO fascinating), but Finkel is the most compelling lecturer I've ever had. He's so well–spoken and witty, and he was somehow able to keep 500+ students engaged every class. His use of movie clips to demonstrate each concept was such a clever and engaging technique—not only did they keep lectures interesting, but the real–world examples of the material really helped me understand the content. Readings didn't even feel like schoolwork because they were so fascinating, and exams were very fair. I actually looked forward to learning every class, and I was sad when it ended (that never happens!). Such a well–designed and interesting course. TAKE IT!!",
                    "165": "AMAZING CLASS IF YOU CAN TAKE IT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! It's not quite an easy A, but if you do the readings and pay attention during lectures (which you will) then you'll be okay. Professor Finkel is so awesome and is super passionate about this class. The lectures are super fun and the class is awesome.",
                    "166": "LOVED this class! Different from any other course I've taken at Northwestern.",
                    "167": "The class is definitely interesting but the readings took SO LONG. The exams were so specific so you can't get by with not reading. The class only consists of three midterms so it sucks if you mess up on one of them because your grade can't really recover. A lot of the readings and the lecture were repetitive and could've been concised immensely. Good job on Eli Finkel though for keeping the engagement in class. Lectures were pretty fun honestly.",
                    "168": "Prof. Finkel is a great lecturer. I loved going to his class because he made the content very engaging. The class is all lectures, with readings from a textbook, his book, and articles. The content is so interesting and applicable to life/relationships. The class is 3 midterms, and we finished before Thanksgiving break.",
                    "169": "This class is so fun! Prof Finkel is a very engaging lecturer: he includes video examples during class. The exams were not too hard but you need to do the readings because theres content tested that isn't mentioned in the lecture",
                    "170": "This course is super interesting. I didn't think I'd like it because I don't enjoy the anatomy/biology aspects of psychology, but the course was more social psychology focused and was engaging and cool. The 3 exams were somewhat difficult, which was a bit stressful because your grade in the class is just made up of those three tests, but if you study and do the extra credit you can definitely get an A. Overall I really enjoyed the course and would 10/10 recommend it.",
                    "171": "Take this course! I took it as a Freshman since I tested out of intro psych, and even still it felt like an interesting, engaging, and relatively easy psychology course to begin with. Professor Finkel is amazing and so, so engaging as a lecturer. Lectures were super enjoyable, informative, and funny. The 3 midterms were definitely not an easy A by any means, but they felt doable. Take the extra credit opportunities, and you should be fine. Also, NO FINAL!<br><br>I would say my one gripe with the course is its lack of focus on LGBTQ+ identities they basically had one lecture allocated to this taught by a TA student, but it didn't feel nearly as engaging or informative as other areas of the course. This is more so a problem with the field in general, though, so I can't blame this totally on anything that Professor Finkel is doing wrong. I would still suggest the course either way!",
                    "172": "Awesome course. Every person ever would benefit from taking this class.  Fair bit of work has to be put in to do well but very manageable and the stuff you learn is applicable to every relationship you have with anyone (platonic, romantic, family, etc.). Awesome and funny professor who engages the 300 person lecture hall.",
                    "173": "This was a very interesting class and lectures were actually fun to attend",
                    "174": "First off let me say this. This entire class is based off a pseudoscience. In the very first lecture they start off talking about why psychology is actually a scientific field, as they go on to prove within the courses that it is anything but scientific. There is a clear agenda that Professor Finkel is trying to push, which most of the psych majors fall for because  nu is all about being empowerment rather than any form of common decency for your anyone not yourself. They don't realize all this class is, is an advertisement for you to be Finkel's book, the all or nothing marriage, which might was well just be called the nothing marriage. Because after taking this class, that's how you feel. Love is dead. Western civilization is on the brink of collapse.  And if you want to make it to whatever dystopia this class predicts in the next year, all you have to do is incorporate the dark triad of personality traits into your identity. So if you meet any of the following criteria, you would be the ideal candidate for this class: i) crippling insecurity issues, ii) absent father, iii) belief that infidelity is righteous, iv) innate desire to gaslight and manipulate, and v) murderous rage at any person who gives the slightest inconvenience. This probably won't get posted to CTECs but if it does and if Finkel is reading this, I hope you are proud that you've corrupted the minds of good college students while empowering the 2% of psychopaths to go out on a MISSION to destroy any prosperity in love Americans could feel.",
                    "175": "The lectures for this class were entertaining, there are a lot of rom–com clips! My only complaint for this class is that there are 3 exams that determine your entire grade (plus some extra credit). You can for sure get a B if you put in the effort but an A is a little harder since there are no other grades. This was one best psych classes I have taken, but only having 3 exams to determine the entire grade spoils it a little bit. But Eli Finkle is an amazing and caring professor!",
                    "176": "Loved this class so much. Professor Finkel very clearly knows what he's talking about and does a great job of keeping the class entertained during his lectures. Barely any work outside of class and exams are very doable as long as you pay some attention during lecture and maybe review the slides and readings a few times. Super enjoyable class and I highly recommend to anyone who wants a fun class to take, whether it's for a major or distribution requirement or just for fun",
                    "177": "This course was so much fun to take. Learned a lot about something as practical as relationship advice while also not feeling overwhelmed by all the psych terminology.",
                    "178": "This course explored various intriguing topics in people's relationships that are pertinent to our daily lives. I was able to apply the theories and concepts from this course into my daily life and past experiences.",
                    "179": "SO glad I took this as a disto because it was absolutely one of the best classes I've taken at Northwestern. SUPER interesting material that is so life–relevant, and Prof. Finkel is awesome. Exams are not gimme points, but they are honestly a very good and fair metric of whether you studied. Literally loved this class and wish I would have majored in psych now, a little too late bc I'm a senior but OMG. Amazing. Take this class!!!",
                    "180": "I thought this class was fun (plus Prof. Finkel is a great lecturer!) but I thought the exams were tough at times so I'd only really recommend it if you think you're a good test taker. Since the course is only really based on 3 exams, it puts a lot of pressure to do well on each exam. I don't do too well with multiple choice so the exams were tough for me, but I thought the content was very interesting and the lectures always featured clips from rom–coms or shows which was fun!",
                    "181": "Lecture is more like a one hour educational standup comedy set, with movie clips sprinkled in. Material is interesting, professor is funny, midterms require you to study and do the reading, but typically aren't unreasonable. Good course.",
                    "182": "very interesting and applicable course, everything feels SO organized and controlled, exams and grading very fair, excellent prof",
                    "183": "MY FAVORITE CLASS EVER. Please take this class. Professor Finkel is hilarious and very engaging during lectures, it's hard to get distracted. Not to mention, all the topics are super interesting and many are relevant to real–life matters. I learned so much about myself and my own relationships in this class, I truly feel that I came out of it as a better person.",
                    "184": "I loved this course! I'm actually not even that interested in romantic relationships, mostly taking the course because my friends were in it. But the 80–minute lectures passed by quickly and I was extremely engaged the whole time. The professor is so enthusiastic, loves the topic, and is one of the most knowledgeable people in the world for this field of psychology.",
                    "185": "Aside from the exams being wonky at some points, the overall class content was enjoyable. The professor is great at teaching and has humor. I do wish the professor and TA’s provided practice exams before the actual exam since knowing definitions of concepts is different from knowing how to spot them in scenarios.",
                    "186": "I'm someone that easily falls asleep. And there were many days I would walk into class TIRED and ready to sleep. But suprisingly, I've only fallen asleep during one lecture. Which is pretty rare for me, especially for a lecture–based class. That is to say the lecture content is interesting and presented in an entertaining way. The Prof is funny and presents many examples using pop culture references that feel natural.",
                    "187": "TAKE THIS CLASS!! The professor is funny and engaging, and the lessons/lectures are very easy to follow. Just attend the class, pay attention, and take notes. I personally did none of the readings and was still able to achieve over a 90% on each of the exams. There is no other homework or assignments throughout the quarter, so as long as you study for the exam you're fine! The topics and information are also super interesting, so it makes it easy to study/remember. I applied so much of what I learned in this class to my own life and started psychoanalyzing all of my friends' relationships (as well as my own...). TAKE THIS CLASS!!!",
                    "188": "This was the most engaging and entertaining class I have taken at NU. Prof Finkel is the best professor I have experienced at NU. The class consists of just 3 multiple–choice exams which are very challenging but manageable.  I wouldn't describe the class as an easy A, but some of my friends got As. If you are good at multiple choice, it'll be pretty good but for me, I'm bad at multiple choice exams generally, but I am still looking at a grade in the B range.",
                    "189": "Finkel is such a great lecturer. Every class was so interesting and I was actually excited to learn about each concept. I would def recommend this class. The exams aren’t too bad you just have to really know your stuff because it gets pretty specific.",
                    "190": "Eli Finkel &lt;3 the best lecturer I’ve ever had, every lecture was so fun and so easy to understand. The tests were a little difficult/poorly written but other than that I love this class!",
                    "191": "Great class. Decently hard to be honest. But the material is so interesting way worth taking. Just do the readings and you will likely be fine.",
                    "192": "This course was so interesting and a lot of fun to take, BUT is by no means easy and a class that I had to accept a B in. Your ENTIRE GRADE is based only on 3 exams, each of which are 60 multiple choice questions, and then 4 extra credit points that don't really do much to help your grade. I feel like the tests didn't do a good job of seeing if you understood the material, because sometimes I felt like I understood everything and was prepared, but then did badly. Also the questions would sometimes be worded weirdly and because of the multiple choice format, I doubted myself a lot and kept switching between answers. I did very badly on the first test, which meant that 33% of my grade was already down the drain and I had to do really well on the next two to try and get it up. I wish the grade in the class was structured differently and your entire grade didn't only rely on what circles you filled in on 3 tests. Prof. Finkel is so funny and engaging and creates great lectures with interesting and relevant videos from good movies and TV shows. The only homework is readings from a textbook, Prof. Finkel's book, and sometimes an outside article, and they can get a little repetitive. You don't have to do the readings before class and can leave them until closer to the test date if you are busy in other classes. I ended up doing that and using the readings to prepare for the test and I don't know if that was the best method. My TA, Erin, was very kind and available to meet, but still I feel like the format of the test was so annoying and unfair that it made it difficult to do well in the class. The average for the first test two tests was 87, but I feel like most people I talked to weren't doing very well and an A seemed like a hard grade to get in this class unless multiple choice tests were a format you enjoy.",
                    "193": "I found the class very engaging and looked forward to going to lectures. However, the readings for the class were so long and honestly the majority of them felt unnecessary. I think it would be considerate if he gave specific pages that were important to read in the text instead of the whole textbook chapter with information we never talk about again.",
                    "194": "This is the type of class that you would like to sit and be a part of just as an outsider. The grade is made of three 60q exams + up to 4 percentages of extra credit added to final grade. Definitely review the outside readings for each exam, around 15% of each exam is not lecture–based.",
                    "195": "Amazing course, would def recommend to literally anyone. Finkel is a great lecturer; he's super engaging and always makes sure there's time for questions. There are three non–cumulative exams across the quarter– these are essentially the only things going into the grade book, so each one is a third of your final grade. This class is unfortunately really heavy on the readings, but if you skip all of them, you should still be able to get a passing grade !! (but don't expect an A without them, because Finkel pulls a decent amount of exam questions from the readings) All in all, if you have the option to take this class,, take it. Like 10/10, take it.",
                    "196": "Great class if interested in psychology and how it plays out in interactions with others. Helpful for those in relationships or for those who want to be. One of the best psychology classes I have taken at Northwestern. I liked the assessment structure with three exams, but no cumulative material. It was like high school and having \"unit\" tests. The learning format was easy to digest, the materials (textbook and print out readigns) supplemented what was taught in class, and Professor Finkel found ways to make it relatable.",
                    "197": "This class is awesome. These are some of the most engaging and entertaining lectures I've been to, and everything feels applicable/relevant to real life. Professor Finkel is super funny and knowledgeable and includes lots of pop culture examples in his slides to drive his points home. The class slides are also organized super well and have most of the information you need to study class material for the exams. The only downside is that there is a LOT of reading, especially at the beginning of the class, and you really do need to do the readings to do well on the exams. However, skimming/looking for key terms/examples in a pinch will help a lot, especially because it feels nearly impossible to get through everything when reading deeply and taking notes. But it's all worth it – 100% recommend this class the class materials and readings are all super accessible and interesting!",
                    "198": "This class was fantastic! Very interesting, and the way Dr. Finkel structured lectures made it easy to learn and understand what was going on. It was pretty straightforward, but Finked stopped frequently to answer questions. It was a bit heteronormative, and the two lectures that went beyond heterosexual couples weren't very thorough. Only three exams made up our grades and they were pretty straightforward as well! We read an easy–to–read textbook, supplemental readings, and a book Finkel wrote. Sometimes it felt like he centered his own relationship a bit much, but, hey, it was his lecture and his book, so it is what it is. Take this class!",
                    "199": "BEST CLASS EVEEERRRRRRRR! <br>Professor Finkel is an amazing and riveting lecturer. This was one of the BEST classes I've ever taken at Northwestern.<br>Only three midterms and you will end before reading week. <br>Lots of readings but if you stay on top of it, studying for exams won't be bad at all.",

                    "0": "I loved how passionate Professor Mroczek was while talking about each topic. He was really helpful, especially with providing resources for our papers.",
                    "1": "Professor Mroczek is awesome! You can tell that he is super passionate about the material. The assignments are very manageable, just two 10 page papers and 2 quizzes, and grading is very fair.  Would definitely recommend this class.",
                    "2": "This course was absolutely amazing! Very eye opening in terms of changing habits to promote longevity, and the material was very stimulating.",
                    "3": "It was a pretty chill class with a very lovely Prof. Lectures are super dry and boring, but you don't have to do much work other than two long papers and two in–class quizzes. Take if you're interested in learning how adults age",
                    "4": "The course included very interesting material about aging. Certain topics are kinda common sense (e.g. \"chronological\" vs. \"biological\" age) especially if you've been taking other psychology or biology courses. My favorite part of the course were the two 8–10 page papers we had to write. The first is a \"Life Projection Paper\" where you predict how your life will play out up until your death. The second is a \"Life Review Paper\" where you interview someone 65+ and write about their comprehensive life story. I found both assignments to be incredibly valuable and fun. You also have two short quizzes that take around 30 minutes each. Overall, this course is interesting, pretty easy, and fun! While the professor is very very kind and supportive, he does tend to go on tangents so it can be a little difficult to pay attention in class.",
                    "5": "prof mroczek is a great lecturer, very passionate. I haven't taken a psych class before and just took this because it sounded interesting, and it was a little hard to care about some of the topics but I still enjoyed listening to the lectures. very generous grader for the two papers, and the two quizzes were free response but everything was from the slides",
                    "6": "I really enjoyed this course! Professor Mroczek is really passionate about teaching the material, and he communicates the content really well. Although the grading scale looks pretty intimidating (A is at least a 96), doing well in this course isn't that challenging. There are only two short quizzes that are pretty easy, so long as you review the content in the lecture slides beforehand. There are also two papers that take a lot of time to finish since they both must be about 8–10 pages long, but as long as you start working on them in advance and meet all of the necessary criteria, you should be fine. Overall, I would definitely recommend taking this course!",
                    "7": "Take this class!! It is absolutely amazing! Prof. Mroczek is the funniest guy, a fantastic lecturer, and makes the class so interesting. The whole class is 2 quizzes and 2 8–10 page papers that are actually enjoyable to write. I was skeptical when I heard people say that before, but it definitely is true. It is a very low stress course as well and is unlike any other psych class I have taken at Northwestern because it actually discusses aging into adulthood while most other classes focus on adolescence or childhood. If you have the chance, take this course. Even if you do not take it for any reason, it was such a good class and really enjoyable.",
                    "8": "Classes were interesting and not mandatory but the two quizzes are based off of the class material, so it doesn't hurt to go. The material was interesting and Professor Mroczak is super passionate about this subject. The quizzes were 5 questions which means missing one can really jeopardize your grades, but the papers are worth more and are pretty nice for reflecting on your life.",
                    "9": "Would recommend the class, there isn't a lot of work besides the quizzes and paper, but they're relatively easy. You also learn a good bit about the factors that lead to aging. The professor is also really nice.",
                    "10": "The essays are meaningful.",
                    "11": "This was a great class and Dr. Mroczek is an amazing professor! The class is made up of 2 quizzes and 2 8–10 page papers. All the assignments are pretty much due towards the end of the quarter which made the class a bit stressful during that time, so definitely try to get ahead on the assignments. Dr. Mroczek is also super understanding, supportive, and engaging.",
                    "12": "Dr. Mroczek is awesome and this class was fantastic. Learned so much, not too big a time commitment.",
                    "13": "Mroczek rules. He wants people to ask questions and be interested in the material. Class was very casual. The 2 papers were a little daunting to get started but were really interesting and I feel like I personally gained something from writing them. The 2 quizzes were very straightforward. Take this if you can",
                    "14": "A really interesting class and the professor is so sweet! The papers are kind of fun to write and the exams are 5–6 questions from the slides. The exams are memory based and not difficult. Overall, I would really recommend this class I learned a lot and it was not very hard.",
                    "15": "Mroczek is amazing! He's incredibly friendly and responsive with answering questions in class. I found the class to be very manageable– there were just 2 papers and 2 quizzes. If you go over the slides and pay attention you should be able to do well on the quizzes, they were just five open–ended questions that asked general concept questions. I really enjoyed doing the papers! The first one asks you to project the future of your life and the second one asks you to interview an older adult and analyze their life (we didn't get the second paper back yet but the first one was graded very generously). Take this class!",
                    "16": "This class was awesome, would highly recommend! The grade is based fully on two 8–10 page papers and two 5–question short answer quizzes, so the actual week–to–week workload was super manageable. I found the course content incredibly interesting and relevant, and the two papers were a really fun way to apply that content knowledge to real life (one paper asked you to predict the course of the rest of your life based on research findings, and the other asked you to interview an older adult about their life). Prof. Mroczek is clearly so knowledgeable and passionate about this subject and really encouraged us to ask questions and share our reactions to what we learned.  I'll take what I learned in this class with me through life — would definitely recommend this to psych majors and non–psych majors alike!",
                    "17": "This was a great course with a nice blend of biology and psychology. I would recommend to anyone in neuroscience or psychology!",
                    "18": "The only work you have to do for this course is 2, double–spaced, 8–10 page papers. Sounds like a lot, right? But the first is \"What does the rest of your life look like\" and is mostly creative, and the second is \"Interview someone over the age of 65 and summarize their life story.\" Super chill, I think everyone I know went WAY over the limit just to finish their thoughts. There's 2 tests as well, but they are 5 short–answer questions taken from the VERY main ideas of the course. Like literally, its a breeze if you study a bit. I think my friend and I guessed 4 out of the 5 questions on the final. It's that clear, prof just doesn't care about tricking you in the slightest. Lectures are super fun, its mostly Mroczek going on rants about all the crazy stuff he knows and you asking whatever questions you have about the topics because you're so interested. Slides can be a lot, but if you focus on the main ideas, its chill. Readings each week were really interesting, and not too much if you are willing to skim (they're all research papers, so just read abstract, skim intro, skim discussion, read conclusion and you're chillin). Readings aren't even necessary for the course, most people didn't do a single one. I found them interesting enough to read for the sake of it, though. Be prepared to be talked at a lot, and come in with some interest and curiousity, and this will be a super fun, chill class.",
                    "19": "I absolutely loved the content and the professor. I want to study aging as my career now, this is how much I loved this class!",
                    "20": "Professor Mroczek is super kind and understanding, and is clearly really interested in what he teaches! This course was interesting and so applicable to daily life, and there isn't much work besides two short quizzes and two papers. The two papers were pretty lengthy but not hard, and the second one was really fulfilling and wholesome! I really enjoyed this class!",
                    "21": "Great course, take it with Dr. mroczek he knows what he's doing.  2 essays and 2 midterms and everything is super straightforward.",
                    "22": "I LOVE THIS CLASS. small class and learned so much yet stress–free. Grades are based on presentation, discussion, proposal, and outline.",
                    "23": "discussion posts due every class and one large final project. the posts could be time–consuming, but all the readings are so interesting. professor mesghina is amazing – everyone should take this class to learn more about themselves and the world around them. highly recommend.",
                    "24": "This was a great class! The discussion–based style works really well, since it lets everyone connect the content to their own experiences, which helped me understand course concepts a lot more. Prof. Mesghina is great and always willing to help students. Readings are interesting and very relevant.",
                    "25": "Great class! Bookclub–style classes were super fun and engaging!",
                    "26": "I loved that class. We got to explore so many topics that I already think about on my own. I also loved how discussion–based it is. Professor Mesghina is great",
                    "27": "I loved this course considering that I am not too fond of cognitive psychology! Professor Mesghina is AMAZING, and this class was amazing as well! There was a lot of participation required through discussion posts due before each class (consisted of concise summaries of readings, two implications, and a discussion questions), leading one class discussion, and participating during class, but the environment she created made participation very easy! The final for this class consisted of a group project that incorporating class readings/ideas and our own interests. You work towards this project throughout the quarter, but it does get busier as the quarter comes to an end.",
                    "28": "This class was awesome. Professor Mesghina is genuinely one of the best professors I've had at Northwestern and truly cares about the students in her classes. The course material itself is super interesting and she makes an effort to cover a wide range of information under the topic that students can really connect with. The assignments aren't too bad– discussion posts (321s) for every class that she gives really good and appropriate feedback on, one discussion lead, and a group project. The group project can be either good or bad so choose wisely on who you work with and what you are doing",
                    "29": "This is the best class i have ever taken at northwestern. So interesting and the structure was great. Usually for classes without exams I feel like I don't learn as much, but I remember so much from this course ad learned so much from the practical implications",
                    "30": "I highly recommend this as a 300–level elective for any psych major or minor. Professor Mesghina is an awesome instructor and I actually liked going to class (which is rare for me)! We learned about how intertwined cognition and emotion truly are by exploring a range of topics like advertising and consumer decision–making, elderly people, stereotype threat, academic stress, botox, etc.<br>This class was run like a book club. There were no lectures; every day was a discussion facilitated by 1–2 students, where we talked about the assigned readings (&lt;30 pages). It was actually fun to participate because the readings were engaging and everyone had interesting stories to tell. The class size was small so participating was not intimidating. Even though class was 80 minutes long, the time went by fast.<br>Before each class, we would have to submit discussion points for the assigned readings called 3–2–1’s. They consist of a 3–sentence summary, 2 implications (theoretical and practical), and 1 question. Even though it’s not much writing, the purpose was to be strategic with your words and come to class prepared.<br>Just once, everyone had to lead the class discussion (either with a partner or alone). It was very low–pressure, and all we had to do was briefly summarize the readings for the class and throw out some discussion questions.<br>In the second half of the quarter, we worked on a group final project. It was enjoyable because we could do research on a topic we were actually passionate about. On the last day, each group presented their topics to the class.<br>Grading: 25% participation, 25% 3–2–1’s (written discussion points), 25% discussion lead, 25% final project.",
                    "31": "This is probably one of the best courses I've taken at NU so far. Mesghina is an absolutely amazing professor and the way she de–centers herself to allow for discussion amongst everyone is incredible. Discussions are actually fruitful in this class and the class topics were always super interesting. I learned so much here partly due to the way we were free to take our conversations any way we wished to while also having structure from a designated discussion lead for the day. Loved this class so much.",
                    "32": "The course gives an introduction to R starting with basic programming and descriptive analyses followed by more complicated analyses like regression, factor analysis, mediation, and item response theory. The course was useful in getting to know your way around R, especially using the psych and psychtools packages. The examples we went through in class were helpful to learning and the reference datasets were easily accessible. I found the classes on basic statistics easy to understand, but when it got to more complicated topics, it was a bit harder to grasp because of the speed at which those topics were covered. The organization of the class could also be improved. Sometimes it felt like we were bouncing from topic to topic and it was difficult to keep track of where we were in the course and what we were learning.  I appreciated learning how to create an R Markdown document.",
                    "33": "Very knowledgable, entertaining, and kind.",
                    "34": "Well, this class was… interesting. Basically this class is titled incorrectly. It is NOT an introduction to R class. It’s an advanced statistics course, with some R, where you sit and listen to him talk about this research a few times a week. There was very light homework and a final project, but there just wasn’t a whole lot in this class to start with. Probably should have some coding experience before taking this if you actually want to learn something, but you could definitely pass this class without learning R at all. Most people were so confused they just stopped showing up for the lectures. Wasn’t a fan.",
                    "35": "Although many of the nitty–gritty details of the statistical tests kinda went over my head, the TA (shoutout to Kayla!!) was super helpful at clarifying concepts and helping me debug code! I'm very grateful I took this class since I feel like I could run my own statistical analyses on my own now, or at least I have more awareness of the questions I need to ask to run tests successfully.",
                    "36": "Lectures were really hard to follow; this is not an introductory level course to R, but you will definitely learn a lot even if you don't get most of it.",
                    "37": "I went into this class with not a lot of stats background which I definitely recommend getting before you take the class because he can go over some pretty complicated concepts. The homework isn't too bad, most of them are based on completion which is nice but you still need to learn the concepts for the homework that is graded based on correctness. Overall, I really enjoyed learning in this class because I've never worked with R before and it was super interesting.",
                    "38": "If you really want to learn R, this is a decent class to take. The more you practice, the better you get. However, Professor Revelle is not a great teacher. The lectures often felt disorganized and sometimes unrelated to the weekly assignments we were doing. There seemed to be a disconnect between the prof and TA. Once Prof Revelle didn't even know what the homework assignment was and wouldn't have taught us what we needed to complete the assignment if students hadn't asked him to. He also wasn't great at explaining the stats part of the class. With that said, most of the assignments are just completion based and don't take too long, so in terms of grades, this was a very easy class."

She brings in really interesting speakers, has you take assessments on your own personality, and you evaluate that based on class content. Super engaging class that made me think a lot about my own personality and leadership style. Also would highly recommend that you meet with her on your own time to talk about your personality results she has some great insights! In terms of grading not hard as long as you listen to what she asks you to do. Would recommend this to both psych majors/minors and entrepreneurship minors (and honestly anyone else)!",

The assignments were super vague but not hard.",

                    "7": "This course was interesting in thinking about the typical personalities of CEO's and entrepreneurs. It also had reflective writing pieces where you were able to apply what you have learned towards your own personality.",
                    "8": "This class was cool because there was a new guest speaker every class that brought interesting ideas about their story.",
                    "9": "While I received a great grade and did not have to stress too much about this course because the content was simple, I think some of the instruction next quarter needs modications. There was often a lack of clarity in weekly assignments and even the culminating group project. All readings and podcasts were from the same source. The only times the details of the assignments were ever clarified were after they had been handed in and graded in the comments.",
                    "10": "This class was alright. Pretty easy to get an A but the assignments are kind of confusing and open ended.",
                    "11": "Class was a bit disorganized and it was hard to tell what the professor was looking for on assignments because there were little to no instructors/prompts. Besides that, it wasn't that time–consuming or difficult.",
                    "12": "Every assignment is extremely vague and you won't know what you're supposed to do. TA could not give feedback on my paper because even she was unsure how she was supposed to vague. This class sounds very interesting but I honestly didn't learn much. I could have learned all of the content in a few hours. Easy class but wanted it to be more than it was.",
                    "13": "Interesting course material, but the pace could've been faster, and I think we could've incorporated more diverse sources. I enjoyed learning about the Hogan inventories, and this course was helpful for analyzing leaders and company culture, but I wish there were more material outside of the Hogan ones.  I enjoyed the guest speaker part, but it would've been better if we could've asked them questions too. <br>Tackett has good energy, but sometimes her grading system feels quite opaque, as it took a while to get a clear rubric for the papers. The subsequent projects/papers were graded a bit better, but it would've been nice for this course to be more organized. Overall, interesting class, not super time–consuming, energetic professor.",
                    "14": "Somehow I thought this course was going to be about how to become a better leader yourself, but it was more about studying other leaders and leadership boards in existing organizations, and learning about frameworks for analysis.  There were a lot of guest speakers (one per week) but sometimes they didn't provide much interesting or engaging insight. You spend the whole quarter working on a group project that you get auto–assigned to, so hopefully you like the company and your teammates.",
                    "15": "This course was really interesting for the first half but for the second half we spent so much time on the group project that it got a bit monotonous. The content is really interesting and the weekly readings are not difficult – the assignments were also very reflection based and graded quite fairly. I definitely recommend trying to take the class with friends and forming groups with them.",
                    "16": "This course is very easy, very little work. However, it was the first time Professor Tackett was teaching the course and lowkey it kind of felt like she was making it up as she went.  I was also hoping for more entrepreneurship leadership stuff, but we mostly focused on the psychological profile of founders vs CEOs. I was taking this for my entrep minor, but it definitely leaned more psychology especially since Prof Tackett is a psychology professor. If you want a chill low–stakes class though, this class is for you.",
                    "17": "This class is super easy. You won't really learn that much about entrepreneurial leadership beyond personality traits, but its a super easy workload and class. 3 hour classes every week, part lecture part guest speaker. We spent way too much time working on the easiest group projects, but honestly, i didn't complain!",
                    "18": "easy class. material was very repetitive but guest speakers were interesting. chill professor – she’s super passionate which made the content more interesting.",
                    "19": "This class is insanely chill. There are very few guidelines, deadlines, or expectations. Throughout the quarter you work on one main group project which concludes in a 15 minute presentation split between 4–5 people. Other than that there are 3 papers talking about personality tests. I would reccomend the class tho. The content is cool and I like how it brings together two different subjects.",
                    "20": "I think it is noteworthy that this was the first time this class ran, and the professor was out with covid for either 2 or 3 class periods. The class itself was good but a lot of items surrounding the class were not ideal. The class was incredibly disorganized and one of the TAs had no clue what was going on in the class. We only got to start properly learning about halfway through the quarter because of things mentioned above. With that being said, the material was fun and engaging and there was not too much busy work.",

                    "23": "This was the worst and most meaningless course aI took at Northwestern. It's academic objective was extremely vague and disorganized. Professor seems nice, but this was the first time she taught the class. There were no rubrics or detailed instructions on how to do the assignments and the assignments themselves were extremely vague. The 3 hour classes seemed to dread on and although it was an interesting topic, the class didn't really explore it. There are so many great PSYCH classes at NU and this one is most likely not worth your time."

The discussion–based environment made it more comfortable in terms of being able to delve deep into the material when applying it to sports, and it was a very supportive classroom to be in. This course is only taught every 3 years (sadly) so whenever you get the chance, take it!",
                    "1": "I really enjoyed this course with Professor Smith. He was a great lecturer and really cared about us learning and our interest in sports. I learned a lot and my interest in different sports definitely peaked throughout the quarter. There are three homeworks, a group project, and a final exam in this class. Overall, I enjoyed the class and would recommend it for anyone interested in sports and the psychology behind many aspects of it.",
                    "2": "Good and interesting class, but the Canvas is very disorganized. Assignments in Canvas have no deadlines or instructions, and are only announced in class.",

                    "4": "Really enjoyed this class as a cross between statistics, data analysis, psychology, and decision–making. Prof. Smith is a phenomenal professor who knows how to make the content interesting, present complicated subjects in an easily–to–digest way, and had thought–provoking assignments and discussions. I really liked how the class covered all sports and used data as a basis for decision making.",
                    "5": "Super interesting class, lectures talked about different stats in different sports and if you're into sports it's really interesting. course load is pretty manageable, only 3 hw assignments, a final project and a final exam. H. David Smith is super nice and easy to communicate",
                    "6": "This course was interesting. The professor is not only super knowledgeable but also kind and genuinely cares about his students. He is very quick to respond to emails and is always willing to help! The class setup includes discussions, 1–2 readings before each class, three homework assignments, a group research project, a presentation, and a final exam. It's a well–balanced workload that challenges you to work with sports analytics. The only downside is that while you get grades for your work, there's not much feedback on why you got a certain grade. It's the only thing that could use a bit of improvement, but overall, it's a manageable course that teaches you a lot about sports and data.",
                    "7": "Great class for an intro to sports statistics. Prof Smith is super super helpful in the stats projects",
                    "8": "Overall, a very easygoing and interesting course. Prof HDS enjoys lecturing and tries his best to keep everyone else involved and engaged. The workload is very light, and I appreciated how we were allowed to pick our own directions with the homework assignments and research project. The only thing I disliked was the instructions for the homework were not very specific, making it difficult to make sense of points that were taken off. The final exam was not too bad, as he gave us a study guide with vocab we needed to know. If you take this class because you like sports, you won't be disappointed.",
                    "9": "Loved this class, super informative and cool to learn about sports in class.",
                    "10": "Very chill and informative class. Lectures are interesting and there's not too many assigments, just some homeworks which are very chill, a final presentation which is also chill, and a final exam, which you do have to prepare for and is a little challenging but nothing bad at all. The content in the class is also very fun if you're into sports. Homework guidelines can be a little unclear at times, however. Also, the grading guidelines for the presentation were also unclear. Overall though, this is a very fun class.",
                    "11": "this course was cool to learn about. the class itself is super backloaded but overall not much work at all in this class",
                    "12": "Was an interesting course but thought some of it was a little outdated, would have liked to learn about more advanced analytics. The mix of psych, stats and sports was cool, and the professor was awesome.",
                    "13": "I really liked this course! If you have any interest in sports analytics or anything related to that definitely take this class. It was very manageable and there weren't a lot of assignments and lectures were always interesting. I would highly recommend to anyone who loves sports!"

She's super accomplished in the field of psychology and just an amazing professor and person. All of her research and her personal anecdotes and stories made an impact on me. I went into this class with low expectations because I didn't think I would resonate with the content, but I really enjoyed it. It's almost set up like a SESP class, focusing on discussion and peers talking to and teaching each other. This course changed my perspective on a lot of different concepts, and I genuinely think it has made me a better thinker and more enlightened. It really places an emphasis on invisible social groups and issues. Take this class (or just any class!) with Professor Fryberg!",

                    "7": "This class is rooted in cultural psych theories and is super informative with lots on insightful readings/course materials. Stephanie has so much compassion when she teaches and is such a personable professor.  The class felt like a little family. I liked the fact that it only met once a week (though the block is 4hrs long) and it didn't feel as long because of the mixture of lecture, group discussion, and a bunch of hands–on/interactive activities. There are two major assignments (a paper and a final group paper/project) that she grades generously; it's definitely the type of class where you don't necessarily have to put in a bunch of effort for an A, but she doesn't reward low quality work either.",
                    "8": "Overall an amazing class, though I didn’t learn anything past the second lecture. Steph is a great professor: kind, sweet, genuine, patient, and knowledgeable. Given that she was flying in and out every week to teach, she was stretched very thin, where I felt like the last few lectures were just students talking to kill time.<br><br>There were many classes where Steph were just deconstructing students with our consent. It was truly a therapy session for the students at some point and a coffee  hat at other times.<br><br>One group paper, one group presentation, one additional short paper, plus weekly discussion questions. Super super easy A.",
                    "9": "Take this class! As an aspiring physician, I learned so much in this class and it really forced me to think differently about previous takes I had on cultural issues in medicine. It also made me a better writer and I like to think a better future doctor that will really care about the background and struggles of every individual patient. The best part of this class, however, was Dr. Fryberg. Having a really caring professor like this was really incredible, and really drove my interest in this class even despite external struggles. Dr. Fryberg, despite her expansive expertise and education, was also SO, SO sweet and always ready to help. She was so helpful in how and what exactly I could improve for my final paper, and really inspired me to take up a psychology minor after this class as well as join her research lab. Such a caring and sweet professor and I will 100% recommend trying to take this class with her as I really believe you will learn so much more in class and really care about what is being taught.",

                    "0": "The workload in this class was very manageable with one homework assignment and quiz per week, along with two exams total. Something to be aware of is that midterms do make up a large amount of your grade with the first midterm being worth 30%, and the second midterm being worth 35%. Professor Beeman drops your lowest quiz from each half of the course and averages them to give you the potential to earn up to 2% extra to your overall which is very helpful. I would say that this class is a doable A–, but not necessarily an easy A. In lecture we moved through the slides pretty quickly, and it was often difficult to get all of the information from every slide. Lectures are posted on Panopto, which is helpful if you miss something that was said in class as the slides were not always the most organized, so taking good notes is definitely important.",
                    "1": "Slides were mostly unhelpful when going back to try to review concepts. If you miss something during lecture, the answer will likely not be on the slides. Beeman is a good instructor and passionate about what he teaches.  Definitely have to go to every class to succeed. Exams are long and hard to complete within the class time. Grading on homework and quizzes is fair.",
                    "2": "I actually never intended to take this class this quarter (the class I was supposed to take got cancelled at the last minute, and this was one of the few classes still open that fulfilled the same requirements within Cog Sci). Overall, I’m pretty glad I took it. The material is pretty interesting, and Beeman is a decent lecturer — can be dry at times, but he encourages participation during lectures and will stop to answer student questions. Classic psych class structure, w/two exams and weekly homeworks.",
                    "3": "– Very interesting course, although slides can be very difficult to follow after lecture<br>– Material seemed repetitive at times, which was a little disappointing because it left me wanting more from the class<br>– Workload is very manageable<br>– Prof. Beeman is very enthusiastic and well–versed on the subject, which made class fun",
                    "4": "Slides and pace of teaching are a bit disorganized; often feels repetitive. No reading tho so it's definitely a light–work course. Topic is interesting. Do not recommend to people without previous background in neuroscience as he assumes you know the basics.",
                    "5": "Took this as an elective requirement and although it wasn't bad and the professor was nice, I didn't like the way we only used slides to study from. I think using a textbook or some other kind of material wouldv'e really helped as the powerpoint slides were sometimes hard to follow and didn't really explain very well cohesive ideas.",
                    "6": "Not too difficult of a course, but Beeman's slides/lectures can be hard to follow and his Panoto recordings are often glitchy. The weekly quizzes aren't too bad, but homework can be confusing and is graded somewhat harshly. Exams aren't too bad. Overall, not the worst Group A elective for Neuroscience, especially if you are interested in the content.",
                    "7": "Please listen to my rant. I promise it is worth it. <br><br>Oh my my. There are not enough words to describe why you SHOULDN'T take this class. Even though the course has no pre–requisites, the class does not take into account that people come into this class with no previous psych knowledge. That being said, I want to clarify that it is NOT IMPOSSIBLE to succeed in this class. It is definitely doable. The main reason I took this class was because it counts as a Basic Science requirement for McCormick. <br><br>Bro's lecture slides are actually so horrendously organized and the TA's are super harsh with the grading of the homeworks (which under normal circumstances is fine, if the man taught). I kid you not, the man just talks in theoreticals and questions. I have never heard him actually answer a question straightforwardly. <br><br>For the 2 exams, he basically tells you that you need to figure out what is important to this class. And basically interpret the class. If you want a low effort class, go ahead and take the class, because I promise it is 10 times less work than any STEM class, which requires a lot of thinking. The class takes more effort around the exam time. If you want an easy class time–commitment wise, take the class. Otherwise do not recommend.<br><br>If you do plan to take the class, go to the lectures, even though you may not understand what the professor is talking about.",
                    "8": "This is a good class, especially if you're interested in language/linguistics and the related neurological functions. It's not too much work. He records the lectures but it's still nice to go and people ask good questions in class. 2 midterms (one is 30%, second is 35%), weekly quizzes, weekly/biweekly homework. Pretty normal for a psych class, I think. Definitely doable and interesting if you put in the effort to learn!",

I liked going to the TA rather than the professor for help because at times I felt that the professor made me feel stupid while the TA really helped me and explained things a did not know. You have to go to class  because even though there are recordings a lot of times the audio would not work and the professor will not help you understand what you missed. the slides are not enough to understand all the concepts because the quizzes and exams have things he elaborates on that are not written on the slides. overall the class was okay",
                    "13": "The only strength of the course I see is the energy of the instructor and his passion for neuroscience. Prof Beeman really means well and is eager to teach. I find this to be inspiring and commendable. I wish I would have seen more instructors like him at NU in this respect. However, there were two problems with the course due to which I would not suggest this course to anyone: one is lack of command of the language part of the course on the instructor's part, the second is lacking visual materials (which constitute100% of the study materials for the course).<br><br>First. This is a course on Brain *and* Language, as the title suggests. While the instructor is undoubtedly an expert in the brain part of the course (I couldn't judge that though), I think there were very serious deficiencies in the language part, which I have been studying at NU for three years. These deficiencies made this course quite an unpleasant experience. I can describe a few of these instances: <br>(1) UG discussion. I stopped coming to class (but watched the recordings, of course) after the lecture on \"Universal Grammar\" where we were taught that the concept of US is related to is represents what is common to all languages. That's just not true. I hope that this was because the instructor wanted to *really drastically* simplify the content –– which is somewhat odd for a 300–level course. If not, it would mean that the instructor is just not familiar with one of the concepts he is teaching. UG is a fundamental and important concept in the 21–st century linguistics and a quick wikipedia read, let alone a more comprehensive overview of literature, would reveal that UG is a genetic endowment, rather than something like \"all languages have subjects\". It's about DNA, not about subjects and objects.  I mention this because almost an entire class period was spent on this somewhat misguided discussion.<br>(2) Language acquisition. It is an interesting claim that language acquisition can occur without \"knowable input\". I've taken classes specifically on language acquisition and we were taught exactly the opposite. I think as the critical periods attest, there can be no acquisition without input. Which is maybe why the discussion of critical periods was also confused:<br>(3) In the discussion of critical periods, those for L1 and L2 were confused. The critical period for L1 (Lenneberg 1967; Fromkin et al 1974, etc.) does to close at puberty, but much earlier. The umbrella term \"critical periods\" of L2 covers at least 7 very different hypotheses, none of which were mentioned.<br>(4) The IPA that the slides were referring to is not International Phonemic Association, it's International Phonetic Alphabet. Phonology and phonetics are quite different, which wasn't really mentioned.<br>(5) I am not a phonologist, but I feel a phonologist would have much more to say than me about some of the lecturing/discussion that took place.<br>etc.<br><br>To sum up, I realize this class was about Brain and Language and most of the discussion was great and helpful for the brain part, but I found that the discussion of the (a lot of elements of the) language part was not at all on the level of the discussion of the brain part; not ever near. Wherever students asked questions about language part (when I heard them in class), the answers were also quite lacking.<br><br>Second. The visual materials for this course, to my view, are extremely lacking. For a course that includes the discussion of visual perception and such, I cannot understand how the slides can be quite so chaotic. There's plenty of research in learning theory on the impact of visual materials on learning; I think those can be quite useful.<br><br>Lastly, the TA's grading really depends on the TA (out of two). If something I write is erroneous, one of them would explain the specific part that is wrong, whereas the other it seems would just state what they expected me to write. Sometimes I saw no difference between what I wrote and what TA saw as correct, but little clarification was given. If one runs a regression between grades given by one TA vs the other one, I feel one is very likely to find quite a significant difference and a big R^2.<br><br>I hope others had a much better experience than me.",
                    "14": "THey drop lowest quiz grades and homework grades so you have plenty of opportunities to bring you grad back up",

His lecture videos also sometimes would not record audio making reviewing for exams a bit more difficult.

Professor Gorvine provides really interesting readings and poses super interesting and challenging questions for the class to discuss, even trying to incorporate current events like the Isreali/Palestinian conflict in an unbiased and fair way, which I have not seen accomplished by any other professor. The class is definitely more towards the humanities side than a classic psychology course, so be ready to read and write. Overall, great course!",
                    "7": "This is one of the most thought–provoking classes I've ever taken. We were exposed to the perspectives of different parties during the Holocaust through a variety of sources, including historical documents, theoretical papers, empirical studies, documentaries, movies, etc. It really challenged me to take a holistic view and reflect on how and why the Holocaust happened, who should be responsible, and how to prevent future genocides. Prof Gorvine is amazing at leading discussions on difficult subjects and making connections to current events, and he creates a safe and open space for everyone to share their perspectives. The small–group discussions we had were the most in–depth and fruitful conversations I've ever had, and I feel that people who signed up for this class were all committed to exploring difficult topics and having intellectual conversations, and I learned so much from my peers. Although this class was a bit more work than I expected (discussion Q, 4 midterm essays, 1 individual paper, 1 group project+paper), the assignments really helped me to draw connections between all the materials we read about and take a personal stance on those complicated moral issues. Would 10/10 recommend if you are interested in the topic and are willing to put in the work!!",
                    "8": "Good class. Not too much reading, discussion posts every week or so, 2 exam papers, and a final group project that isn't too much work. You discuss some very difficult topics (obviously) but Gorvine does a great job at creating a safe space for discussion.",
                    "9": "I really enjoyed this course! The psychological concepts we discussed apply to so many topics other than the Holocaust and I've found myself thinking about the content more than I would have expected. It was fascinating to learn about the psychology of so many aspects of the Holocaust and Professor Gorvine is an amazing professor. Definitely take this class!"

                    "0": "I am a senior and this is the first course I've taken at Northwestern that I've hated.  The classes were difficult to sit through. I think if the professor would have just stuck to his slides, it would have been fine. But he encouraged students to ask questions and somehow students found the most insane and barely related questions to ask. Then he would spend 20 minutes answering just one question.  One nice thing about the class is I had no homework or readings to do. However, I would have preferred readings and homework if it meant I could do well in the course.  Instead, the professor asked the strangest, most confusing questions for the (open note, untimed, virtual) midterm and final supposedly only based on topics discussed in class. I went to every class, took notes, and thought the class would be an easy A. But I didn't know the answers to half the questions. I'm so thankful I'm done with this course. Luckily my GPA isn't ruined because the professor has a generous curve (curves so 89% is the mean for midterm and final and so [I think] 95% is the mean for the final project).  This class is why it's important to look at CTECs before enrolling. On the positive side, the professor did seem to genuinely care and be fascinated about perception and he was very knowledgeable. And I did learn some interesting things about perception that I'll be thinking about for a while.",
                    "1": "I hated this course, do not take it. Suzuki was a terrible lecturer and would not work with students to improve their performance in the course. He also kept saying he hated the regular grading system but continued implementing exams and a subjective final project, despite there being a multitude of other ways to approach course material.",
                    "2": "This class was an interesting experience. There are two exams and a final video presentation. Prof. Suzuki creates test questions based on his memory of the lecture he just gave and will post them on Canvas so that students can answer them during the quarter. Prof. Suzuki tends to get off track and talk about concepts outside of lecture content, so it was sometimes hard to follow alongside slides that were bare of clarifying information. However, after getting past his dry lecture style, I was able to learn some pretty interesting concepts and revelations about perception, especially when it came to understanding the subtle tricks our brains do unconsciously to understand reality around us. Overall, while lectures could be a bit of a slog, I appreciate the things I was able to learn and take away from the class.",
                    "3": "This course was incredibly challenging, not because of the content but because of the lack of organization. There is no structure, no suggested readings, no lesson plan, no themes or topics, nothing. It is completely done on the fly, which is cool, but it leads to an overwhelming situation when faced with taking the exams which account for most of your grade when you are asked very challenging questions solely from lecture material, where the lectures are very hard to follow and all over the place. I would take this class for curiosity, but taking it for a grade was very very stressful, as I attended every class and took as thorough notes as I could but still found myself lost, which does match up with what I heard my classmates saying about this class with this professor. If you choose to do this, I wish you luck, and I advise you have a strong background in neuroscience, cognitive psychology, physics, and biology.",
                    "4": "This wouldn't be my first recommendation for a psych course. The content is interesting but there's no syllabus and it can kind of be all over the place. The midterm and final are open note but the questions can be really challenging (it definitely helps to have a neuro background as I feel some of the content I only knew from other classes). The overall workload is pretty low except for the weekends of the final and midterm.",
                    "5": "I was bored and frequently confused during lecture. Exams had nothing to do with lecture, so this class felt very strange",
                    "6": "This is one of my least favorite classes I've taken at NU, content–wise. With that being said, the workload is really light, so I can't complain too much. Also the prof is really nice. But he explains topics in the most confusing and convoluted ways. The averages on the exams pre–curve were in the high 70s/low 80s.  I actually had an interest in perception going into this class, but unfortunately, the professor went into the most boring topics. All classes are recorded (sound only), which is nice. So, take it if you need to, but there are so many more interesting psych/cog sci/neuro classes out there.",
                    "7": "I thought this was a good course but it was different from anything else I've taken. You only get three grades (two tests and a final project). The professor lectured based on what questions are asked in class and then creates test questions after the lecture based on what he remembers covering. He posts the test questions online ahead of time and the tests are all take–home and open note. When you hear this, the class seems super easy but it was still challenging and our class averages were around a B. I'd still recommend it though and I think it's a good class as long as you show up to class.",
                    "8": "Lectures are hard to follow but the professor tries his best to explain things. There is no work outside of lectures but you need to keep up with the content because it can get really dense.",
                    "9": "This class was very jarring at first because there was NO structure. Each class has a specific topic he wants to discuss, but he also emphasizes that he wants to teach what the students are interested in, so a lot of the class is usually spent answering questions in detail. The lectures were really interesting so the lack of structure didn't really bother me. There are two exams and a final presentation. The exams are open note and on Canvas and you get 3 days to do them. He posts the questions that will be on the exams after each lecture. DO THEM RIGHT AFTER CLASS. He posts lecture slides and an AUDIO RECORDING of the lecture after class so it's best to go to class so you can actually see what he's talking about since the slides are mostly pictures. The final exam was before reading week and the final presentation is a recorded PowerPoint presentation, so this class is technically done before reading week. Overall this class was not bad at all and I think it's a great class for the column B requirement",
                    "10": "this class is really confusing, the professor goes off topic. a lot and goes on tangents. there's very little structure to the class",
                    "11": "Although attendance wasn't necessary, it was helpful to see the slides in class since only the audio recordings of the lecture are provided. Spent very few hours per week on this class and Prof. Suzuki released all exam questions by the time of an exam, but it was definitely not an easy A. The midterm and final exams were take home and basically open note, but I find his questions very difficult to answer, even after relistening to his lectures multiple times. Prof. Suzuki had the genuine intention to ensure students learned the essential meaning behind class concepts, which I appreciated, but I find that he goes on multiple tangents during lectures.",
                    "12": "Teacher is very passionate but sometimes hard to follow.  2 take home exams and a final project. Exams are much trickier than expected so important to go to class!",
                    "13": "Not an easy course. Avoid unless you’re interested in material. Professor Suzuki is both mean and nice, very strange combo.",
                    "14": "This is not an easy psych class –– I would not recommend unless you are able to go to every lecture and pay attention to everything. His exams and content is challenging.",
                    "15": "Covered interesting topics in a very deep–dive way and the professor's enthusiasm for the course is amazing.",
                    "16": "I was a bit disappointed with this class. As a neuro major, I was looking forward to taking a class on what seemed to be the visual system. However, the prof answers any and all questions about the material in full detail, regardless of how random they are. People then ask questions based on that response, and by the end of class, we are so far removed from the relevant content material it’s almost frustrating. It was clear this would be the case after the first class, but people still just never seemed to grasp this and continued asking, honestly, stupid questions. The part that was frustrating was that all of it was testable material. We BARELY covered any real material in this class compared to in years prior, and prof even said that himself.",
                    "17": "This class was extremely hard to follow and relies way too heavily on what a handful of tryhard students have questions about. This leads to the class being super disorganized and very hard to tell where one topic starts and another ends. If someone asked me what I learned in this class I genuinely don't think I could explain a single concept even though I got an A.",
                    "18": "This course was less stressful for me because of its format where exam questions are posted after each lecture. However, you kind of have to go to class because even though audio is recorded it’s much easier to understand the material and saves more time so you don’t fall behind on exam questions.",
                    "19": "Long lectures",
                    "20": "If you are interested in continuing on to a medical field, this class is good for you; otherwise, it may not be the right choice because it is quite difficult to learn anything from lecture unless you are VERY interested in the material and spend a lot of time learning by yourself. You can still do well though in this class if you just go to lecture because prof. Suzuki posts each answer that will be on the final exam after each class– so if you know how to answer those, you could easily get a high score on the exam.",
                    "21": "Prof is good, class is like ~0 work next to studying because the grade consists entirely of two exams and a relatively short presentation project. It's a good class to take alongside a heavier courseload. However, the material is kind of dense, so it's not a free A or anything. In case you miss lecture, Prof uploads audio recordings, but IMHO they are completely useless without the visuals, so it would probably be better off to pretend that there is no recording/lecture notes/etc. uploaded at all.<br><br>Even though it could get dry at points, I think there are a lot of interesting topics covered in the course that would be hard to access without it. Also, of all the psych I've taken so far, this class is the one that really cements that existential dread that comes from realizing everything one does and experiences is fully explained by physical processes happening in the brain.",
                    "22": "I love how the professor followed student interest by responding to questions. I'm not that interested in perception overall but had a lot of fun doing the final project",
                    "23": "The material in this course is solely based on what the professor finds interesting and noteworthy, which makes the material meaningful to learn. It was hard to pay attention for the full 80 minute afternoon lecture and could seem a bit disorganized. Dr. Suzuki is very passionate about this course and wants his students to succeed both in the class and beyond. He would often incorporate his own philosophy on learning, meaningfulness, fulfillment, and grades–leading me to take away much more than just psychology from this course.",
                    "24": "professor is very sweet, definitely take this class it is good for gpa, questions are all based off of what he lectures on in class, generous scales",
                    "25": "Prof. Suzuki is awesome. He cares very much about the class and the students. But the class is the hardest psych class I have taken, tests are very hard (although take–home), but he curve a lot. I did learn a lot through the course.",
                    "26": "The content of the course was interesting, and Professor Suzuki was very enthusiastic about teaching the course.  Exam questions were based on the lecture, and were posted after every class with an audio recording, which was helpful. However, the lectures were not very well organized (confusing powerpoints, lots of tangents, audio recordings were difficult to use but were necessary for answering exam questions). It was a good class to fulfill the natural science distro as a cognitive science major, but I would have not taken it otherwise",
                    "27": "I thought this course would be an interesting class, but it is heavily focused on vision. The exams are quite difficult despite it being take home and sometimes it is hard to grasp the material since the prof is beyond too smart to be teaching this course.",
                    "28": "This class is not an easy A if you don't go to class. If you go to class I would say it's not that bad. The exams are hard, but they're take home and he releases a few questions on the exam after each class (you basically will have the entire exam before the midterm is even posted). That makes it easy if you just keep up with the questions! I did that for the midterm and got an A, but then I didn't do that before the final and got a B– so just keep that in mind. The final project is also pretty easy if you pay attention and he tends to give really high grades on that. He also curves exams to an 89–90% which is nice. This professor is amazing and is super engaging, so I do recommend the class if you are interested in it. However, if you aren't interested in it it probably isn't worth your time because it is a lot of material and the exams are not super easy if you aren't paying attention. Also form a study group when you take the class or take it with friends. It helps so much knowing other people in the class in case you miss a class.",
                    "29": "The class is 2 take home exams and a final project that is a video presentation about something you learned. The exam questions are posted before the test, but they are written really poorly and very confusing.",
                    "30": "Professor Suzuki is such a nice person who really cares about the stuff that he's teaching. He's super knowledgeable too, but it can be hard to follow along in class or apply the knowledge from class to answering the test questions. He does scale the median for each grade to be a 89%, though. But you need a 95% in the class for an A. It's doable, just stay on top of the exam questions (all MC) as he releases them. Also, really do ask questions in class if you're confused. There were a few people in our class who always raised their hands to say that they were confused or to demonstrate their interest in a certain topic / how it applied to other life situations, and Professor Suzuki was always so willing to take as much time needed to help that student understand. And I really appreciated those students for taking one for the team because often times, our entire class would be confused, but most people would be too scared to speak up. But the more questions that are asked in class, the easier it is to answer the exam questions, and sometimes, the Professor would even help us with exam questions in class because he simply appreciated the way we were showing up. As long as everyone got fair hints, then he didn't care about helping us on the exam / leading us to the answer! My biggest piece of advice for this class is to take as detailed notes in class as you can because the lecture slides don't often have words or neat bullets on them – it's a lot of complicated diagrams that Prof talks about. After the class, go back and listen to the posted audio recording (bc lecture videos aren't recorded) and write down important phrases / sentences that he used in the parts that you were confused about. A lot of the questions could be directly answered based on what he said in class, but you just might have to dig for it. Don't let the content pile up b/c then you won't feel motivated to find the answers for the exam, and it will be much harder to do well."

It develops on the foundations of social, personality, and developmental psychology in a totally coherent way. Definitely not overwhelming like other row 2 classes can be, and it is very manageable. Prof. Chung also is just the absolute best. She really cares about her students and is passionate about teaching the course, which makes understanding the content so much easier to do. The class is 2 article summaries, a child observation paper (which you get to visit a preschool during class to observe the children to write the paper), a film/tv paper, and a final research proposal. If you aren't the biggest research person, I think this is a perfect choice for you because I am not, and I still feel like I got a lot out of it and enjoyed it anyway",

The final research analysis is worth <br><br>so a considerable amount of work and when you turn one paper in there is another one to start working on. i would recommend this class though and she's really accomodating.",
                    "6": "This class is really interesting! Throughout the quarter not too much work, just readings and a few short papers. The final paper is a lot of work though.

                    "7": "This was a fun and energizing class!

There seemed to be a lot of overlap from personality, social, and developmental psych, but the main difference was the focus on reading and writing research summaries and a final research proposal.

The exams are nice because you get to skip two short answers but otherwise are definitely exams you have to study a lot for and I was regularly very stressed about them because there was so much information covered. Prof Weisleder is great though and she clearly cares about what she is teaching and about the students in her class.",
                    "1": "This was Professor W's first time teaching this course and so she wasn't really able to gauge how much she could get through in each lecture and in the course as a whole, making the course disorganized. The tests were super reasonable tho and she also made sure we were clear on what was on the exam beforehand. There are a lot of non–psych/neuro majors taking this class so it does move really slowly if you already have background in cognitive psych. It is basically the same course as PSYCH228 Cognitive Psych.",

Professor is really nice and engaging, and the material is not too hard as someone who has never taken a neuro/psych class before. Beginning part was more neuro/technical but became more concept based after the first 2 weeks.",
                    "4": "While I thought the course content was very interesting, as someone with little background in cognitive psychology/neuroscience, I thought this course was not the easiest class to take. I also think having my grade be solely based on 3 exams and one extra credit opportunity, was a bit hard as someone who is not the best at exams. That being said, Professor Weisleder is such a helpful professor and is really great about taking student feedback and applying it in her course. She was always very willing to meet with me outside of class to go over concepts and exam grades. You can also just tell she is very passionate about this subject so I thought lectures and office hours were very engaging as well!",
                    "5": "This class currently is made up of 100% exam grades, with an equal contribution from 3 exams. I wish there had been some kind of homework or something act as a grade–booster because that can be a bit stressful. There was an extra credit opportunity at the end, which could raise your grade a maximum of 3 points, but I wish there were more. I did really really like this class and I thought the subjects themselves were very interesting.",
                    "6": "Personally, I liked this class. I think Professor Weisleder is very nice and definitely has a passion for what she teaches, although she definitely would rather be teaching a class more focused on language processing. I didn't have any background in neuro or psych, or CSD at all, and while I do think it is possible to do well in this course without having that background, it felt like I was playing catch–up all quarter. I also do think that the grading is pretty unforgiving, not in the sense that it's overly strict, but there's very little you can do if you underperform on an exam, which I did. Despite really improving over the course of the quarter, I don't know if my grade fully reflected that. Anyone can do well in this course though if you are willing to read the textbook and use the study materials provided.",
                    "7": "Course was exciting but I was expecting it to be a bit more. I enjoyed that it thoroughly followed the textbook. Slides had only pictures and barely any text, so going to lecture is a must. Exams were honestly quite hard.",
                    "8": "I would highly recommend taking this class. Professor Weidleder is really sweet and clearly cares a lot about her students learning. Since this was her first time teaching this class, she made a lot of changes to accommodate us and adjust the pace of the class. There are three tests and an extra credit opportunity, which I really liked. The tests are very fair and there are extra review sessions and practice questions for every lecture that she gives.",
                    "9": "Exams are straightforward and exactly like the study questions Prof gave us. Easy A if you memorize the lectures. Don't need to read the book",
                    "10": "Your whole grade for this class is made up of 3 exams. The exams were not that challenging, especially since there were assigned study questions for each one. I'm not sure I learned that much more in the class than I had in previous Psych/Cog Sci classes, except right at the end. Professor Weissleder was very sweet and wants her students to do well. If you want to learn more about the brain without going into too much neuroscience detail, this is a good class to take.",
                    "11": "Loved this class! super interesting stuff and super sweet prof. 3 non–cumulative midterm exams that are multiple choice and very short free response. They are the only grades, so each is 33.34%, but they are not bad. Professor Weisleder also was super accommodating for trying to improve the course. She asked for feedback, and addressed everything single thing mentioned. She also started providing review questions (which are practice test questions and are perfect for studying) for every lecture, which was awesome.",
                    "12": "This class has a heavier neuro focus than most psych classes I've taken, and there are a lot of neuro majors in this class, which I felt made it harder. The overlap with the neuro major makes it easier for neuro majors to grasp and use the concepts, especially for exam questions asking about different regions/pathways/mechanisms of the brain. I felt like I had to put in a lot more time outside of class to reach the same level of understanding. The grading of exams was also pretty picky about including enough detail about the nuances in how the brain works/how specific studies were set up/etc., and I felt that even if I understood the major concepts, it was hard to get full credit on some questions simply because they wanted more specific details on how exactly things worked. It's a lot of memorization of specific studies, brain regions, conditions, etc.",
                    "13": "I really enjoyed this course. Professor Weisleder is a great professor. She modified the course schedule so we would have more time to go in depth on certain topics / make sure the material was clear, which I really appreciated. I found this course really interesting and engaging, especially because it focused more on understanding research and experiments relative to other classes I have taken for my cognitive science major. I would definitely recommend this class."

                    "0": "I honestly really liked this course. I was scared going into it because of previous CTECs I had read, but I really think you should not be discouraged from them. As a freshman, I was daunted by the first few lectures because it seemed like there was a lot of basic neuro info we were already expected to know, but that ended up not being an issue.  A lot of people seem to take issue with the format of the lecture slides, but I honestly thought they were fine. The professor is really nice and he posts class recordings. I actually ended up not going to a lot of the classes and just reviewed the slides and class recordings from home and took notes on them, and  I was still able to learn all the material. I also found the topics we talked about to be quite interesting. There was basically no work outside of classes which was nice, and the readings were not necessary. We also had an at–home quiz each week, which was a great way to get points. The final is 50% of your grade, but if you review the study questions and take notes throughout the quarter, it truly isn't as daunting as it seems. I originally took this course because it was the only psych class left during registration, but I overall found it to be a decent class and what you would expect from any neuro–focused psych class.",
                    "1": "Not as bad as the other CTECs say. There are weekly quizzes but they are take home so not bad. There are no midterms. Ken Paller chooses pretty interesting topics and he records his lectures. So you can just watch the lectures at home double speed. Most of the work is during the last two weeks of the quarter (the final exam (free response) and a project).",
                    "2": "Although I found course material interesting by the end of the quarter, it’s important to note that 50% of your grade for this course is the final exam. There are weekly quizzes and assignments but the bulk of your grade is one test. This means that you have to hold yourself accountable to keep up with the material on your own. Lecture topics were engaging but the lectures themselves were a little difficult to get through every week. The lecture slides don’t contain all the helpful information. However, when you go over the slides while listening to the class recordings (professor recorded the classes), it’s a little easier. Also, for the final exam you only really need to focus on the lecture (not the textbook). Overall, if you’re SUPER interested in the topic, I would take the course, but if you’re looking for an easier distro or an interesting psychology course, I would shy away. I had to spend a good amount of time preparing for the final.",
                    "3": "This course was interesting and the professor was very passionate BUT his slides were impossible to follow and his lectures were so confusing. After going to every lecture, I had to rewatch the lecture just to slightly understand what was going on. Also, I do not understand why the final was 50% of our grade and cumulative when we had time to have multiple other midterms. I think the course could be better organized.",
                    "4": "This was a very interesting coarse that was manageable if you followed along with the material each week. I learned so much about brain disorders and the functions of brain regions as a result.",
                    "5": "TAKE INTRO TO NEUROSCIENCE BEFORE TAKING THIS COURSE!!! I know there are a lot of negative CTECs about this course, but I think the majority of them revolve around the fact that there is a lot of required previously known knowledge to understand what is taught in this course. Professor Paller does teach at a fast pace, and his slides could be better organized, but you can get past those things pretty easily with a previous understanding of basic Nueroscience facts. This course is awesome, though. Super fascinating, and so sick to learn about the neuroanatomy of cognitive deficits. But ya, if you wanna take this course, TAKE INTRO TO NEUROSCIENCE BEFORE TAKING THIS COURSE!!!",
                    "6": "This course is definitely a bit intimidating but manageable. The assignments and quizzes are very fair and the lectures make sense once you go back through them. The final being 50% of the grade is pretty scary though.",
                    "7": "The content is well–organized and interesting, Paller does a pretty good job lecturing. The final is cumulative and there is a lot of information, so it was time–consuming to study for, but the format (answer 14 of 18 or so questions)  made things a little easier. The only thing that was a little unusual about this course was assignments that were due after the cumulative final in the middle of finals week. It just made planning studying a little challenging. Also, there is a 50% grade reduction for an assignment being late at all, which can really hurt your grade given that assignments are worth 40%.",
                    "8": "The weekly quizzes were a great way to study for the final navigate the course material. The beginning of the course was very challenging for me because I didn't have a neuroscience background, but after getting over that hump, the lectures made more sense. I will say that the slides were difficult to follow because they were very dense, but the lectures are recorded so it was helpful to go back and relearn things I didn't understand the first time.",
                    "9": "This class was very very boring I'm not going to lie. The professor just drones on and on and the projects/papers are kind of hit or miss. At first it was nice to have a Psych class that didn't have the usualy Week 3–6–9 midterms, but that just meant the final exam was like 50% of the final grade and we didn't really have anything to prepare for it.",
                    "10": "it was fine. lectuers are recorded. they're not super helpful except some random things are in the final",
                    "11": "This was a great class! Very well organized, making the content flow together and connect rather than jumping all over the place. The instructor was very nice and well prepared, making him a great lecturer – he did not simply repeat what is on the slides but added his own commentary while still sticking to the content on the slides. You will need to keep up with reading and studying for the exam at the end but that is not too bad at all; the assignments and quizzes are not difficult but require a bit of work to do well.",
                    "12": "I had taken this class, thinking it would be mostly psychology, and a break from STEM material as well as a chance to get through some DISTROs in Weinberg. This class is not a class one can sleep through and blow off lectures for. However, it is a very fun class to take. Learning various conditions, the neuroscience behind them, and the story of their discovery, analysis, as well as what we still have yet to learn regarding the brain is fascinating. The coursework is very forgiving, and the tests and exams were great summaries and applications of the material in class. Nothing felt unfair, and the instructor was extremely understanding as well.",
                    "13": "Very interesting material. One final exam worth 50% with the other 50 coming from weekly canvas quizzes and some writing assignments  that were never too hard. All lectures are recorded which was nice too",
                    "14": "It's a fine course. Just pay attention to lectures. It's a little annoying that the final is 50% of the grade. I would rather have 3 midterms than a 50% final so then we know how the grading operates.",
                    "15": "I am a bit biased, because I love the topics covered in the course. I thought the material was incredibly interesting, and fun to learn about. Professer Paller is so nice, and is always able to talk after class and answer any questions. The slide presentations are quite difficult to follow, as they are quite disorganized, however Panopto recordings for every lecture are available to students. Quizzes and Assignments were graded very fairly, and the final exam, although 50 percent of the grade, allowed us to select 4 questions not to answer, with was very helpful. I loved this course, and would certinaly recommend it to anyone who is interested in this topic, but probably not to people looking for an introduction to basic level neuroanatomical ideas, or to anyone who is just looking for a distribution credit.",
                    "16": "This class is very unorganized, you also won't learn much. the final exam is not bad – I learned most of the things from this class by reviewing for this exam",
                    "17": "A great course covering many fascinating aspects of cognitive neuroscience, brain damage, and consciousness.",
                    "18": "Very neuro heavy, but interesting. Good lectures and easy assignments.",
                    "19": "This class was very interesting, the lectures are recorded, and the professor is very very accommodating and is very good at explaining the concepts. However, the slides were a bit hard to read which was a bit inconvenient at times.",
                    "20": "This was an interesting class but it was disorganized at times. Professor Paller is a very nice person and you can tell he is passionate about the subject but he speaks as if you already have background knowledge of neuroscience coming in. There are weekly quizzes and a few written assignments and one final midterm at the end. Near the end I felt as if I was rushing because there was so much material to be learned for the midterm and it seemed impossible to memorize everything. I definitely recommend studying for the course as it occurs and rewatching the lectures. Overall, it was an interesting class but the organization could use some work.",
                    "21": "I think people are a little harsh on this class. It wasn't THAT bad. The content is interesting. Best advice is to keep up with the material, do the readings, put the lecture notes into flashcards and reinforce each week. By doing this you will be prepared. Slides are disorganized and so much content to study for. Super time consuming",
                    "22": "This course involves a lot of reading with short weekly reading quizzes. Other than that, there’s only one final, which is extremely stressful. The professor does not even provide any practice exams, so you go into the final with no idea what the structure of the exam will look like. Also, I took this class with no background in neuroscience, and even though neuroscience technically isn’t a prerequisite, I wouldn’t recommend taking this class without some neuroscience background. It’s a difficult class for people who do know neuroscience, and if you don’t, the neuroscience that you need to know is only covered once, very quickly during a singular lecture. I had to spend a TON of extra time learning those things in my own time."

                    "0": "The workload in this class was very manageable with one homework assignment and quiz per week, along with two exams total. Something to be aware of is that midterms do make up a large amount of your grade with the first midterm being worth 30%, and the second midterm being worth 35%. Professor Beeman drops your lowest quiz from each half of the course and averages them to give you the potential to earn up to 2% extra to your overall which is very helpful. I would say that this class is a doable A–, but not necessarily an easy A. In lecture we moved through the slides pretty quickly, and it was often difficult to get all of the information from every slide. Lectures are posted on Panopto, which is helpful if you miss something that was said in class as the slides were not always the most organized, so taking good notes is definitely important.",
                    "1": "Slides were mostly unhelpful when going back to try to review concepts. If you miss something during lecture, the answer will likely not be on the slides. Beeman is a good instructor and passionate about what he teaches.  Definitely have to go to every class to succeed. Exams are long and hard to complete within the class time. Grading on homework and quizzes is fair.",

Overall, I’m pretty glad I took it. The material is pretty interesting, and Beeman is a decent lecturer — can be dry at times, but he encourages participation during lectures and will stop to answer student questions. Classic psych class structure, w/two exams and weekly homeworks.",

                    "4": "Slides and pace of teaching are a bit disorganized; often feels repetitive. No reading tho so it's definitely a light–work course. Topic is interesting. Do not recommend to people without previous background in neuroscience as he assumes you know the basics.",
                    "5": "Took this as an elective requirement and although it wasn't bad and the professor was nice, I didn't like the way we only used slides to study from. I think using a textbook or some other kind of material wouldv'e really helped as the powerpoint slides were sometimes hard to follow and didn't really explain very well cohesive ideas.",
                    "6": "Not too difficult of a course, but Beeman's slides/lectures can be hard to follow and his Panoto recordings are often glitchy. The weekly quizzes aren't too bad, but homework can be confusing and is graded somewhat harshly. Exams aren't too bad. Overall, not the worst Group A elective for Neuroscience, especially if you are interested in the content.",

Even though the course has no pre–requisites, the class does not take into account that people come into this class with no previous psych knowledge. That being said, I want to clarify that it is NOT IMPOSSIBLE to succeed in this class. It is definitely doable. The main reason I took this class was because it counts as a Basic Science requirement for McCormick. <br><br>Bro's lecture slides are actually so horrendously organized and the TA's are super harsh with the grading of the homeworks (which under normal circumstances is fine, if the man taught). I kid you not, the man just talks in theoreticals and questions. I have never heard him actually answer a question straightforwardly. <br><br>For the 2 exams, he basically tells you that you need to figure out what is important to this class. And basically interpret the class. If you want a low effort class, go ahead and take the class, because I promise it is 10 times less work than any STEM class, which requires a lot of thinking. The class takes more effort around the exam time. If you want an easy class time–commitment wise, take the class. Otherwise do not recommend.<br><br>If you do plan to take the class, go to the lectures, even though you may not understand what the professor is talking about.",

He records the lectures but it's still nice to go and people ask good questions in class. 2 midterms (one is 30%, second is 35%), weekly quizzes, weekly/biweekly homework.

I liked going to the TA rather than the professor for help because at times I felt that the professor made me feel stupid while the TA really helped me and explained things a did not know. You have to go to class  because even though there are recordings a lot of times the audio would not work and the professor will not help you understand what you missed. the slides are not enough to understand all the concepts because the quizzes and exams have things he elaborates on that are not written on the slides. overall the class was okay",
                    "13": "The only strength of the course I see is the energy of the instructor and his passion for neuroscience. Prof Beeman really means well and is eager to teach. I find this to be inspiring and commendable. I wish I would have seen more instructors like him at NU in this respect. However, there were two problems with the course due to which I would not suggest this course to anyone: one is lack of command of the language part of the course on the instructor's part, the second is lacking visual materials (which constitute100% of the study materials for the course).<br><br>First. This is a course on Brain *and* Language, as the title suggests. While the instructor is undoubtedly an expert in the brain part of the course (I couldn't judge that though), I think there were very serious deficiencies in the language part, which I have been studying at NU for three years. These deficiencies made this course quite an unpleasant experience. I can describe a few of these instances: <br>(1) UG discussion. I stopped coming to class (but watched the recordings, of course) after the lecture on \"Universal Grammar\" where we were taught that the concept of US is related to is represents what is common to all languages. That's just not true. I hope that this was because the instructor wanted to *really drastically* simplify the content –– which is somewhat odd for a 300–level course. If not, it would mean that the instructor is just not familiar with one of the concepts he is teaching. UG is a fundamental and important concept in the 21–st century linguistics and a quick wikipedia read, let alone a more comprehensive overview of literature, would reveal that UG is a genetic endowment, rather than something like \"all languages have subjects\". It's about DNA, not about subjects and objects.  I mention this because almost an entire class period was spent on this somewhat misguided discussion.<br>(2) Language acquisition. It is an interesting claim that language acquisition can occur without \"knowable input\". I've taken classes specifically on language acquisition and we were taught exactly the opposite. I think as the critical periods attest, there can be no acquisition without input. Which is maybe why the discussion of critical periods was also confused:<br>(3) In the discussion of critical periods, those for L1 and L2 were confused. The critical period for L1 (Lenneberg 1967; Fromkin et al 1974, etc.) does to close at puberty, but much earlier. The umbrella term \"critical periods\" of L2 covers at least 7 very different hypotheses, none of which were mentioned.<br>(4) The IPA that the slides were referring to is not International Phonemic Association, it's International Phonetic Alphabet. Phonology and phonetics are quite different, which wasn't really mentioned.<br>(5) I am not a phonologist, but I feel a phonologist would have much more to say than me about some of the lecturing/discussion that took place.<br>etc.<br><br>To sum up, I realize this class was about Brain and Language and most of the discussion was great and helpful for the brain part, but I found that the discussion of the (a lot of elements of the) language part was not at all on the level of the discussion of the brain part; not ever near. Wherever students asked questions about language part (when I heard them in class), the answers were also quite lacking.<br><br>Second. The visual materials for this course, to my view, are extremely lacking. For a course that includes the discussion of visual perception and such, I cannot understand how the slides can be quite so chaotic. There's plenty of research in learning theory on the impact of visual materials on learning; I think those can be quite useful.<br><br>Lastly, the TA's grading really depends on the TA (out of two). If something I write is erroneous, one of them would explain the specific part that is wrong, whereas the other it seems would just state what they expected me to write. Sometimes I saw no difference between what I wrote and what TA saw as correct, but little clarification was given. If one runs a regression between grades given by one TA vs the other one, I feel one is very likely to find quite a significant difference and a big R^2.<br><br>I hope others had a much better experience than me.",

The class is not a lot of work, but I do think 90% for the final paper is a lot. It is hard because you don't know how the professor grades until the very end, so it would be nice to have more feedback throughout. Professor Rips is very nice though and great to talk to.

If you’re anything like me (respects research but would rather not read papers as a proxy for what could be summarized in lecture slides/notes), you will likely burn out. <br><br><br>In addition to the weekly readings/writeups, each student gives a minimum of 2 presentations on, you guessed it, research papers (!!) throughout the quarter. These were frustratingly time consuming between the length of time it takes to actually read and understand the papers and then summarize them for a 20 minute presentation. The research paper at the end of the course is quite long (minimum 15 sources and 13–15 pages with 1.5 spacing—so basically 8–10 pages single spaced) and frankly was the cherry on top of the burn out cake for me. I don’t think it would have been as bad if the learning format were more varied, but synthesizing a paper of this length after a whole quarter of doing nothing but reading pages upon pages of dense research was beyond mind–numbing.<br><br><br>Overall, even though I really liked the professor, I do not think the class expectations and format are suitable for most undergraduates—the only students who should enroll are those who <br><br>a. are about that PhD life<br><br>b. have an irrepressible zest for language and cognition<br><br>or (ideally..)<br><br>c. are both a and b<br><br><br>If none of these descriptors apply to you, I wouldn't.",

Because she is so familiar with her own work, her grading is so harsh because if you mess anything up, she notices immediately. The class has pop quizzes that are super hard. One time every single person in our class got a question wrong and she shrugged her shoulders and said it should have been easy because it was something we'd covered.",

That said, THIS IS NOT AN EASY COURSE. The readings take some time and can sometimes be difficult to process. There are also weekly reading commentaries due each week, 2 presentations throughout the quarter, 1 final term paper. The work is difficult but can be enjoyable if you have a strong interest in the subject and in Professor Gentner's work.",

But be sure to actively pay attention and take notes during class because the exams will require you to memorize a lot of information from both the lectures and assigned readings (more heavily weighed toward lecture material). You can lose points quickly that cumulate if you do not remember and the only components that make up your grade include midterm, final, and a group presentation. Aside from that, the material and content itself is interesting, although can get a bit repetitive as it is a bit of a limited field of study.",

There is very little probability/calculations in the lectures (which are the focus of the exams), so it wasn't too bad.<br><br>As for the structure, there were two tests (one during finals week) and one group presentation during the last week of class on decision–making in a field of choice. Around two pieces of reading per class (generally one chapter from the textbook and one research paper).

The class was very straightforward, two exams, one group presentation, couple of readings (that you don't have to read deeply) for each lecture. The exams were hand–written though, which kind of sucked, but they were really straightforward, and the professor never really tried to trick anybody up. The group presentation was of a topic of your choice with a group of his assignment.<br><br>I highly recommend this class to anybody who is looking for an relatively easy and extremely interesting class.

The workload consists of few articles each class, 3 take–home exams, and an op–ed paper on a topic of your choice. As long as you're attending lecture (which I always looked forward to) and taking notes, the class is very manageable. Highly recommend!",

In fact, it was so fascinating that there were many times when I found myself talking about the class and readings to my non–psych friends to see what they thought. Overall, I feel like I learned more about myself and the world in general by taking this course.<br><br>The class was also very low–stress. There were readings but none of them were super long (and once again, super interesting so not hard to get through at all), three non–cumulative take–home exams, and a short final paper where you could write about anything you want.<br><br>Prof. Engeln has expressed she might not want to teach this course in the future, but I really hope she does because I loved it!!",

It's definitely a lot of work and the exams can absolutely be shortened but she has you apply the concepts you learn in a way that is actually beneficial for learning, not just regurgitating. It requires you to think deeply and it was a meaningful way to learn. I wouldn't recommend it if you have a crazy workload in other classes because the take home exams will take a long time and you can't leave them until the last minute but overall I'd really recommend the class and renee obviously she's the best.",

Renee is absolutely lovely and the classes are always enjoyable. You have 3 take–home exams that you have a week for – start early and do it gradually as it can take more than a day if you're being picky about your answers. In class, take a lot of notes as not a lot is put up on the slides and things she says will turn up on the exams. You also have a paper which is fun as it's about your interests. Renee is extremely flexible and understanding of the fact we may have other time constraints – do take this class with her if you can.",

                    "6": "Amazing course with heavy commitment. If you already have a busy quarter and this is not your requirement, maybe.it's not the best idea to choose this course. The reading and workload was a lot but the material and the class dynamic was fabulous..",
                    "7": "This class is super fun and engaging. Really awesome to learn about how psychology is involved with the legal system.",
                    "8": "This class is so so interesting! You learn a ton about the intersections of law and psychology, ranging from competency to stand trial to the death penalty, and there is not a single boring topic in this class (but I am a Legal Studies/Psych major so I may be biased). Prof. Broaders does a fantastic job of getting everyone engaged in the class and facilitating productive and thoughtful conversations on each topic. The workload can be a lot, as this class is very reading heavy, but nothing unmanageable. The only challenge I particularly faced was in terms of grading, as it can be a bit hard to know what Broaders is looking for in the weekly assignments, but the time spent in class makes the grading honestly irrelevant, just because it is so rewarding in how much you learn. If you are a Psych major at all interested in legal studies (or vice versa), I would highly recommend taking this class if you can.",
                    "9": "This class is super interesting, but can be a lot of work so I'd recommend only taking it if you're actually really interested in the intersections between psych and law. The class is long, but Broaders always tried to give us a break in the middle which was nice. I really liked how she never really lectured, everything we did in class was pretty collaborative and interactive, and had us sharing our thoughts a lot. The readings were usually pretty long/there were a lot of them, and you have to write a weekly discussion question thats around a page based on the readings. The readings and discussion question usually took me a lot of time, so I'd say don't take this class if the classes you're taking it with are also very time intensive.",
                    "10": "Really awesome class! I looked forward to each class because the discussions were always so engaging.",
                    "11": "This was truly an amazing class. The three hours flew by every week to the point where I felt like I could stay longer and keep discussing. Professor Broaders clearly cares about the material and the class, and it shows. Classes range from guest lecturers to heated discussions to real time experiments! I think this is the first class I've been in where everyone actively participates and tries, and not because there are participation points but because everyone is interested. Professor Broaders also brings snacks to class every week which is fun. The discussion questions require you to put in work and do a LOT of reading each week, which I was nervous about because I struggle to do a lot of reading like that. But I was genuinely interested in the readings so I didn't mind doing it (which was a shock). I think the class was very fairly graded too which is nice. STRONGLY STRONGLY STRONGLY recommend taking this class if you can manage to get a spot!",
                    "12": "Highly recommend this course! It’s probably my favorite course I’ve ever taken at Northwestern!!! All the course content is SO interesting and class discussions really added to them. If you’re even slightly interested in this course content, take this class!",
                    "13": "The readings and content are eye–opening. In–class discussions are okay, but not as good as past CTECs claim. 40% of grades are weekly discussion questions, which is not easy to get A. I find the grading criteria and feedback for DQs very vague. It is a bit frustrating to not know where and how to improve these DQs. Other than that, this class is pretty good.",
                    "14": "Loved this course! One of the best classes, if not the best class, that I've taken at Northwestern. I really enjoyed everything I learned. The discussion questions were hard to prep for each week, but by integrating feedback, after a while, you get used to writing them. While the readings were heavy, they were all applicable and I really found myself doing all the readings each week out of pure enjoyment. It's a great class!",
                    "15": "I really enjoyed this class and especially the hands–on activities we did such as simulating being detectives compiling the eyewitness testimony and or memories of the class (which showed eyewitness testimony is to a degree faulty) and the several documentaries we watched together. If you are genuinely interested in the intersection of psychology and the law, I recommend this course but it will be a grind because the class is only once a week. But you will see that all of the readings and material is worth doing besides just for your weekly discussion post because we really do end up covering and discussing a majority of the assigned material. You are able to take away many important findings such as the ways psychology can inform the legal system. Professor Broaders also is a very invested and passionate lecturer and cares that you understand the material (she also often brings snacks to class so it is generally a fun and chill class environment)! If you put in the work that is expected of you, you should do well and feel that you have gained a lot from the course as I did.",
                    "16": "This course was amazing! If you have any interest in law, you should take this class! If you have any interest in psychology, take this class! It's a great blend of the two, and you'll learn so much. Don't be discouraged by the how long the class is –– the professor is wonderful at making class engaging, so it never felt like a drag. This is my favorite class at NU thus far!",
                    "17": "BY FAR MY FAVORITE CLASS AT NU. Take this class if you have any interest in how psych and law intersect. I absolutely loved this class and even though it is 3 hours it flies by because the discussions are so thought provoking. Broaders is so kind and knows how to include everyone in the discussion/make it engaging. Weekly homework took me 7 hours because I found myself really interested in the topics. The final paper is 10–12 pages but you can also choose to submit a video presentation."

You learn a lot of material in the once–a–week 2 hour 50 minute class, and it can be a lot, but I found the studies really interesting and convincing and inspired to make changes in my own life.",

I love how the professor encourages us to choose and pick topics that we are interested in exploring more through class–led discussions, group projects, and an individual paper.",
                    "5": "This is such a great class! Wendi is the best. It's not too much work week to week, but the end of the quarter sneaks up on you and then it's PACKED with assignments, so prepare accordingly. Also the reading quizzes every week are easy and only like two or three points, but those points ADD UP so DON'T FLOP THOSE",
                    "6": "A phenomenal class. You learn techniques that will truly make you able to live a healthier and happier life. Class consists of weekly assignments, a group project, and final paper. Wendi is also the loveliest person on the planet, so if nothing else, take the class for her.",
                    "7": "This was a really insightful and informative class to take! Prior to registering I didn't really know what to expect in terms of learning but I ended up gaining of a lot of applicable knowledge and critical thinking from the research papers assigned for reading throughout the quarter! This is a pretty steady–paced course, very discussion based, and the midterm wasn't that difficult as long as you memorized the types of research evidence that supported the concepts taught in the lectures. Not to mention this class really helps with understanding and adjusting lifestyle habits to better improve your overall mental wellbeing and quality of life! Highly recommend for those looking to fulfill one of their psych major/minor requirements.",
                    "8": "I already had some background understanding of mindfulness and eudaimonic vs hedonic happiness, but this class has definitely taught me of the empirical research that backs up the concepts and interventions. The numerous research examples were very insightful and the interventions helped put the research to the test. <br>Although I did not like having 3 hours of class every monday, Professor Gardner, a wonderful and brilliant professor, made it enjoyable and gave us a break between split lectures. In retrospect, i wish i didnt spend so much time trying to type everything from slides into my notes and just listened to prof give IRL examples and write those down. Slides get posted, but no recording. Highly recommend attending class!<br>The discussion posts kind of got tedious because i would start the readings (4–5 articles/papers) friday or saturday and theyre due 2pm sundays. But they did require me to think outside of the research and how the content can be relevant to my own or others’ lives."

                    "1": "I've wanted to take this course for a long time and I'm so glad that I got to take it before graduation! It was so interesting to learn about how evolutionary and social psychologists explain various phenomena related to human beauty and I've been constantly reflecting on how various factors (genes, culture, media, power structure) contribute to our understanding of beauty and the appearance–related biases that we have. The group research project was also such a great learning experience and I really appreciate how Renee helped us with building the questionnaire and walked us through data analysis step by step. I learned so many useful skills that were not taught in 205 and I would definitely recommend her class to people who are interested in research/data stuff. One small suggestion I would have is to have more in–class discussions since I feel that these topics will spark good conversations (and maybe also include some opinion–based questions in the exam).",

                    "3": "I loved this course and I love Renee!! The course is very low stress with three take–home exams and a group research project. There’s weekly readings that seem like a lot at first, but are actually very interesting and easy to get through, so it actually does not take long at all.  Prof. Engeln is an amazing lecturer and clearly very knowledgeable in the subject matter, but my favorite thing about her is that she approaches the topics sensitively and with a lot of nuance.<br><br>⚠️If you struggle with body image issues or have had EDs in the past, this course can be a little triggering because of the nature of the material so definitely keep that in mind when enrolling",
                    "4": "I loved this class. The readings were so, so interesting and really reshaped how I see the world. The class is made up of 3 take home exams worth 20% each and a group project. The take home exams are hard in the sense that the professor and TA are looking for specifically the strongest evidence even if there are multiple readings that can be applied to a question. Also, the lectures don't really help much with the exams and there are a lot of readings each week so it can feel like a lot. However, the course is super, super interesting and I am very glad I took it. The project is also fine, but it is definitely focused on the latter half of the course which feels a bit crunched sometimes.",

                    "6": "This class is well worth the hype. Definitely take it if you can. Renee is a great professor and the topic is so interesting that sitting through the 3 hour class was totally worth it. One or two of the classes in the middle of the quarter dragged on a little but most weeks were very interesting and stimulating. The class is comprised of three take home exams and one group research project. There are also weekly readings. Sometimes the readings are a lot, but they are usually pretty interesting (and you need them for the exams). I loved this class and it's definitely one of my favorite psych classes I've taken at NU.",

Depending on who in the instructional team grades your work influences how well you do, but please go to OH as that helps a ton. Likewise, sometimes it is easy to get confused on how to exactly apply cultural psych to a specific topic. as most fields haven't had it (that being cultural psychology) applied to it yet, but again, go to OH.

The final project is a paper, and there are no exams, which means you can miss a class or forget about certain concepts without fear of irreparable damage on your gpa, but the final paper does require a lot of reading and research – it was more intense than any writing I had done before. I think that ultimately, this was a very worthwhile class, and even though I took it for my major, I registered for this class before I added a major in psychology – would recommend if interested.",
                    "11": "Take this class! Prof Mesghina is such an engaging lecturer and chooses very interesting articles. She makes the class feel like a discussion section even though it was a decently large class. The final project in this class is a research paper on a topic of your choice so choose something that interests you! Outside of the readings the only assignments help you get ready for the paper (proposal, outline, draft, final draft) which is really helpful. Really well structured, manageable, and interesting class.",

                    "13": "PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU CAN – THIS IS LITERALLY MY FAVORITE CLASS AT NORTHWESTERN This is SUCH an insightful class and honestly like a critical theory of psychology, understanding how research is biased and how psychology has been used for EVIL in the past!! Then understanding even our own class's scoring on different cultural dimensions such as independence, interdependence, etc. and bREAKING the MOLD of a universal psychology across humanity. CULTURE SHAPES ALL OF US AND OUR EXPERIENCES!!! i UNDERSTAND SO MUCH more about my own multicultural background, and how I fit into the world, and how my experience was shaped by culture (of the institution, America, my family, my high school, my political environment, etc)",

She really cares about us, even in such a large course, and carefully considers each assignment and activity given. The largest assignment is a long research paper, but she gives us ample opportunity during the quarter to prepare and helpful feedback. Her expectations are clear and the content is so interesting. It made me think a lot about my assumptions, not just in psychology research, but also in life in general. Take this course if you can!",
                    "15": "I personally liked this class. I will say the lectures themselves sometimes felt long and boring, but some topics were actually really interesting to me. The only major assignment (other than participation) was to write a research paper. It seemed really daunting at first, but it was split up into smaller assignments and the TA's and Professor Mesghina were extremely helpful with every step of the process. I cannot stress enough how wonderful Mesghina was as a professor.",

We learned about the cognitive, developmental, and mental health implications of culture, as well as how to better  assess culture in research. I really liked the structure of lecture as there were class discussion posts to reflect on the content, which required critical thinking about the readings. Moreover, I liked that there were no exams, just one large final paper about any topic in cultural psych that interests you.  Altogether, Professor Mesghina provides really detailed feedback and just wants her students to succeed.",

She is incredibly thoughtful about the content she presents in class and truly made me reconsider how I view human interaction, norms, and societal practices through a cultural lens. She is very passionate and enthusiastic about the subject, which in turn, made me feel more engaged throughout the lectures. She also does a great job of making the lectures interactive and opens up the discussion to the entire class. The overall assignments in the course were not bad at all –– you spend the entire quarter building up and writing your 8–15 page research reappraisal paper. Professor Mesghina breaks up the paper into different assignments throughout the weeks, so it is totally manageable. I had my draft basically written through my outline, so I didn't have as much work at the end of the quarter. Take this class with Prof. Mesghina –– she is the best!!!",

I have had SO many conversations with friends and family about what I've learned here––it really changes your perspective on psych.",
                    "24": "I LOVED THIS COURSE, and I would recommend taking it. Just take it. Not only is Professor Mesghina the BEST, but she also very carefully chooses what to assign for readings and what she will share with us in class while also being responsive to our needs as students. Her teaching style is great since she explains the topics, definitions, and ideas clearly as well as leaves time for us to discuss with others and ask questions as needed. Cultural Psychology was something I didn't know existed but I have come to appreciate it &amp; want to immerse myself into the topic more. This is what our field has been missing – and so many of the missing, key aspects were explained in the course. The readings were all interesting &amp; the course was not too demanding. I can say that this has been my favorite Psychology course I have taken at NU!",

                    "26": "This was a great class, I liked that most of the course work revolved around the final paper and I also appreciated that we had to write a draft and get feedback for the paper. It was very helpful to work on the paper for most of the quarter when I would have procrastinated and not gotten any feedback otherwise. The readings were interesting and Professor Mesghina is great.",
                    "27": "Prof Mesghina is an amazing lecturer!! Each reading was so interesting, and I thought our class and group discussions were always intellectually stimulating. We learned about different cultures' views on mental health and why they react to trauma and interpret symptoms differently. I walked out of this class a changed woman, realizing how harmful it is to accept the Western biomedical model of mental health as the most correct one.   The page minimum for the research paper was daunting at first, but with how much you learn in the class, filling up those pages is a lot quicker than you think.",
                    "28": "I really liked this class! We had in–class exercises for attendance points, and they usually involved discussing the readings so it was important to do the readings. Luckily, the readings were usually short. The main assignment for this class was the final project, where we had to take a cultural psychology approach to a psychological phenomenon (e.g., mental health). This assignment was divided into four parts: the proposal, the outline, the draft, and the final paper. I found this really helpful because it made writing the final paper less overwhelming, as you received feedback from a TA or the professor along the way. Also, if you scored 95% or above on the draft, you didn't have to submit the final paper, which I really appreciated. Overall, I would recommend this class, especially to psychology majors.",
                    "29": "Professor Mesghina is the best professor I have ever had.  She communicates ideas clearly and effectively, making lectures engaging and fun. The readings assigned for this class were also very helpful and well–chosen. Professor Mesghina selected concise readings that were easy to understand. Lectures were interactive and filled with discussions, allowing students to talk to those around them. Overall, I enjoyed this class and always looked forward to attending. I highly recommend it!",
                    "30": "THIS IS THE CLASS OF ALL TIME. This should be a mandatory course for literally every Northwestern student. Every student in the US. I cannot overstate how amazing this course and professor and TAs were. Just incredible. My only ONLY complaint would literally be that I learned too much and I can't live in ignorant bliss anymore. Everywhere I go I see ways in which cultural psychology can rectify or illuminate biases and areas of ignorance in literally every field. I was going to give up on psychology before I took this class. Having marginalized people teach culturally informed psychology should be the norm and it makes me so mad that the larger psych field won't be like this. Professor Mesghina and the TAs were all so receptive to student feedback and were excited to engage in conversation with us about literally anything. You get out of this class what you put into it, and if you have any interest whatsoever in psychology, neuro, sociology, mental illness, cultural difference, racism, bias, literally anything – TAKE THIS CLASS. Seriously. The class of all time.",
                    "31": "Literally such an eye–opening and fantastic class –– taught me a lot about cultural psych and how we should approach research in the field. The professor is super funny and knowledgeable too, time really passes when you're in class. If you have space in your schedule, I'd highly recommend taking this as it'll teach you to view certain topics in a different light.",
                    "32": "Not cross cultural psychology. Still a good class. Expectations are laid out well",
                    "33": "Mesghina is an amazing professor! The course content was very engaging and the final paper was broken into 4 assignments across the quarter, which made it very feasible.",
                    "34": "excellent course to take with prof mesghina, she's very engaging and understanding. the readings were always relevant and lectures were solid too",
                    "35": "This course is incredible! Prof. Mesghina is super passionate and knowledgeable about cultural psychology and does a great job getting you to question seemingly universal truths you have learned in past psychology courses. The readings for each class are fascinating and Prof. Mesghina skillfully breaks them down into digestible bits of information. There are no exams in this class, just one big paper you work on for the second half of the quarter on a topic in cultural psychology, which I think really allowed me to internalize what we learned by applying the theoretical to a topic I cared about.",
                    "36": "loved discussion in lecture and critiquing readings",
                    "37": "Prof Mesghina is really nice, intelligent, and pretty funny too. Class is definitely geared towards psych/cog sci students wanting to go into research. However, I don't fall into that category, and I still got a lot out of the class. Grading is very straightforward and fair– there were no surprises. With the rubrics being published ahead of time, as long as you hit all of the points, you should do well. Attendance required with some flexibility, but class is interesting enough that I didn't mind.  You're allowed to research pretty much whatever you want for the final project, (which was good for me because I knew what I wanted to do). Prof Mesghina and TA's are around to help if you find it too open–ended, though. Overall, I think it's an interesting and relatively easy psych/cog sci course.",
                    "38": "I love the way this has shaped my view of society. A new perspective that I feel more aware of.",
                    "39": "I really enjoyed this class. The only assignment outside of participation is a large research paper due at the end of the quarter, but you are graded for the draft, outline, etc. I do think this class was pretty helpful in the sense of realizing pretty obvious problems with a lot of psychological research. I also love Prof. Mesghina, she's relatable and a great professor.",
                    "40": "Prof Mesghina is wonderful. You work on one big paper throughout the duration of this class, and Prof Mesghina makes it extremely manageable.",
                    "41": "Great class! Professor Mesghina is absolutely wonderful – great lecturer and super interesting course material.",
                    "42": "This course was amazing! Professor Mesghina is always a fantastic and engaging lecturer who is willing to engage with student thought and push everyone to think bigger and connect complicated concepts together. I think this course was really well structured to position the field of cultural psychology within other disciplines and to show how it should be expanded in the future. I would recommend taking this class particularly if you want to think about research in a new way and alter your relationship with the field of psychology as a whole.",
                    "43": "Cultural psych with Professor Mesghina was amazing!! The structure of the class was very different from typical psychology classes, but I found that it was very appropriate for the subject matter and really helped solidify understanding of cultural psychology.",
                    "44": "As a Psych/Legal Studies major, this class helped put everything I have learned in my academics thus far into a cultural perspective. The only true assignment was a research paper that we worked on throughout the quarter and could be on (essentially) any psychological topic of our choosing while putting it into a cultural lens, which I thought was a great way to combine everything we learn in the class with a topic of interest. Prof. Mesghina is fantastic: she is incredibly helpful and kind and truly turned our lecture into an engaging discussion. I would recommend this class to any psychology major, as it gives you the opportunity to look at all of the basic topics you learn in a new and interesting light.",
                    "45": "Ahhhh such a good class! Definitely take this class with Professor Mesghina if you have the chance! she's so engaging and very knowledgeable but also just says very relatable things like...idk stuff that just made it seem like we were all just having a conversation and she was just as interested in our experiences as we were in learning the material in her class and talking about it. Just a very engaging class and really made me think about so many aspects of my life differently as well as the cultural psych as a subject. Genuinely so glad I took this class fr. You do have to write a paper but it's really not too bad and your grade is broken up into sections like part of your percentage is the proposal, outline, then the draft, and finally the final draft and there is an increase in the percentage of your grade with each submission. But even that was ultimately so cool because you get so much freedom with it and you can really research what you want. And now I have a paper that I wrote about a topic was really interested in and how people should take some of the elements we learned about in cultural psych into consideration more when researching that topic and making conclusions. Really cool really cool...take it do it",
                    "46": "This is a really excellent class. The material is engaging and thought–provoking, but not seriously time consuming or difficult to read. The only real homework for the class is writing a final paper that culminates everything that you learn into a unique research paper, which can also be an extension of a senior thesis. This is a great class to take if you are at all interested in doing psychological research as it addresses often overlooked, but very crucial cultural considerations in this kind of research.",
                    "47": "Favorite class ive ever taken at NU! Like amazing! You learn so much, and prof mesghina is just so wonderful",
                    "48": "Really easy grade wise, really good essay feedback, almost zero week to week stuff. You get out of this class exactly what you put in. I put in zero (no readings, didn't pay attention), still got an A cause as long as you hit the rubric requirements for the essay you get a good grade. I do regret not paying more attention though cause everyone else seemed to like it more.",
                    "49": "Prof. Mesghina is the best. Despite there being over 100 people in the class, she did a very good job of encouraging in class conversations and maintaining engagement from her students. If you're someone who likes papers over exams, this is the class to take as there are no midterms and just one research paper, which she guides you through step by step. I think this class was helpful in terms of learning content and gaining writing skills and the grading is not super strict, so definitely take this class with her if you can!",
                    "50": "I thought the lectures were very interesting and engaging, the materials were helpful, and the class/assignments were graded reasonably. I love Dr. Mesghina  so so much!",
                    "51": "Amazing class! Grading was based around a final paper, but was broken down into parts; it was super fair. The lectures were engaging and really made you think about the field of psychology and how research has been done thus far. The professor brought in a lot of different perspectives and allowed the class to form their own opinions. It really changed the way I thought about psychology, and I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to pursue a career in psych; I think it's a crucial topic to learn if you want to engage in research.",
                    "52": "Pretty much the only assignment in this class is one huge paper due at the end of the quarter. Prof. Mesghina is also awesome. However, the slides were confusing and messy. We never actually learned any vocab or cultural psychology terms, just theories that were all really confusing to me.",
                    "53": "Professor Mesghina is very passionate, and it clearly shows in her teaching! In terms of the course, I think the course material itself is also very interesting, but it was hard to feel motivated to actually take notes and do the assigned readings when they are not directly correlated with our grade in the class. Yes, there are in–class exercises, but those can be done easily without doing the reading. This is one of those classes where you can either go with the flow, not really take in the material, and still get by with a good grade, but it also can prove to be very valuable information (which I definitely think it is). I think that Psych majors should definitely take this class! I do think grading is subjective as there are two different TAs along with Professor Mesghina who are doing the grading, so your grade depends on how they grade. The breakdown was roughly 35% in–class exercises (usually discussion posts in a group, and just survey questions), and the other 65% is towards your final paper (5% on paper proposal, 10% on paper outline, 20% paper draft, 30% final draft). I do think the slides could have been a little bit more structured, but I really loved this class! Professor Mesghina is AMAZING, and is always wanting to see us succeed! Not particularly an 'easy A', but definitely an interesting course.",
                    "54": "I absolutely loved this class!! All of the readings were super interesting, and I always walked away from each class feeling like I learned something new and important. Prof. Mesghina is one of the best professors I've had at Northwestern—if you get the chance to take one of her classes, DO IT!! She's an incredibly engaging lecturer, and you can tell she truly cares about her students. Love love love her and loved this class!!!",
                    "55": "Great class to take! Love the prof she is super passionate and relatable, probably one of the youngest and most fun professor at Northwestern. The course grade is based solely on a research paper, but it is broken down into smaller parts throughout the quarter."

She is so passionate about research and teaching and it comes through in her lectures. Instructions on how to succeed and do well in the class are clear. The content is also amazing and super interesting. This completely changed the way I thought about research and psychology, and I learned so much from the class!",
                    "2": "This course was amazing with Professor Mesghina! It's very research/reading based as all the quiz material is on the readings. You also have to go to class to do well. There are participation activities during class, 4 quizzes (can drop one), a proposal, an outline, and a final paper. It was really nice because you basically have majority of the paper written during the year. Overall, amazing class!",
                    "3": "I recommend taking this course as it expands your outlook on psychological research, revealing the Wetsern perspectives it is rooted in. The readings are super captivating and thought–provoking.  The instructor brings a fresh air of youth to her teaching, which is rare and exciting to see.",
                    "4": "This was one of the best classes I've taken at NU. It gave me a whole new lens for looking at and evaluating psychological studies. I could not recommend it more.",
                    "5": "This class was great, I feel like it is one of the most important psych classes you can take. The readings were super interesting and Prof. Mesghina gave very engaging lectures.",
                    "6": "Such a great course! This was very different from previous psychology courses I have taken, and it really changes your worldview. Professor Mesghina provides some really great critiques of general psychology that I will take with me in the future (but she also emphasizes that psychology and psychology research are incredibly valuable fields). Most of the homework is just reading papers in preparation for lecture. There are 4 quizzes throughout the quarter, but you get to take them with a group, which I really liked. Finally, there's a paper due at the end of the class, but you get to submit a proposal and outline earlier in the quarter and get feedback on these before you have to write the final paper, which is really helpful and makes writing the actual paper decently simple.",
                    "7": "This is a pretty good class. There aren't too many readings and the content is very interesting. Prof Mesghina is very kind and the only rough part is the 8–12 page paper at the end.",
                    "8": "This course was awesome! Class is very fun. The quizzes are difficult though, but manageable if you get the general gist of each authors view point. The research paper I thought was difficult and how you should write it is dependent on your TA––so meet with them! Mesghina is awesome!",
                    "9": "Really amazing class. Mesghina is one of the most considerate professors I've had and she is an engaging lecturer. Toward the end of the class, it got just a bit repetitive, but there were some newer topics that kept it interesting nonetheless. The grade breakdown is in–class activities, open note quizzes (that could be done in groups), and a scaffolded final paper. All of them were straightforward if you went to class and did the readings, and there was a lot of creative freedom with the paper. Take this class!",
                    "10": "Professor Mesghina is great. She is super passionate about the subject and the topics are very interesting to think about, she is great at getting the class engaged. The workload is fine, about 4–5 open–note group quizzes which are good if at least one of you does the readings (I don't), and the big assignments are just working up to the final paper which you get a lot of help for.",
                    "11": "incredibly sweet professor and content is interesting. BUT gets so repetitive and boring to the point you feel bad going to class because you know you won't pay attention. Grading is very fair though. start early on your paper. TAs feedback is not the most helpful though tbh",
                    "12": "Ok I love Professor Mesghina, but this class felt really like she was just sharing her opinions and research with us. It also felt entirely race based (which is obviously a major cultural aspect of psychology) but I wish there had been more various topics like corporate culture, college culture, etc. Looking back on the course I actually couldn't tell you what I learned and grading can be pretty subjective. Pretty easy tho so if you are looking for that I'd say go for it but prepare to sit in class thinking \"what???\"",
                    "13": "Really good class and not too hard. Topics are very broad, interesting and related to different societal aspects. Group quizzes are a bit tricky at first but once you get used to how they are arranged and the kinds of questions that will appear you will be so fine.",
                    "14": "The course was really insightful and interesting. There were 4 quizzes(lowest one was dropped; quizzes were done with other classmates in a group) and there was a research paper that you would work on during the duration of the course. Most of the lectures are based on the readings so do the readings(they are necessary). Professor Mesghina uploads every reading to Canvas so there is no need to pay for a book.  You can tell that Mesghina wants whats best for her students. She is an amazing professor; I would even say one of the best ones at Northwestern. If you have the chance to take this course, do it.",
                    "15": "Overall, this class was not bad in terms of assignments; most of it is structured to help you prepare for the final (a proposal around 5 weeks, a outline week 8, and then an 8–12 pg final paper). Professor Mesghina is nice; she makes herself available for office hours/emails/etc, and she's very charismatic. My main issue with this course was mainly the content. Often times the concepts would be so dense/theoretical that I found myself getting lost in what all we were walking about. Plus, we would get quizzed on these theoretical concepts/thought processes, so that would be kind of tricky. However, the quizzes can be taken with groups, so that somewhat makes up for it.",
                    "16": "If the course is open, TAKE IT!! The professor made the class super easy to engage with and super easy to succeed in.",
                    "17": "This is a great great class. Important stuff presented super well, and Prof Mesghina is so so awesome",
                    "18": "one of the best classes because of prof mesghina. she is so real and so knowledgeable and this class reignited my interest in psychology. quizzes every other week in groups are very manageable and the final paper though long is well structured so doesn't feel stressful. profe mesghina is always supportive and there to answer questions and help you further engage in the material. the content of this course completely changed how I approach psych and the world in general.",
                    "19": "Enjoyed this class, opened my eyes to the cultural dimension of psychology that is only briefly mentioned in other psych classes",
                    "20": "One of the best classes I've taken at Northwestern. The professor is so amazing and definitely take advantage of her office hours. Your life will be changed.",
                    "21": "Great Psych requirement to take. The professor is so incredible. There is one huge research paper due at the end but it's also broken down to where you have to submit your proposal and an outline, so you get feedback which is nice. I do think the material is a little confusing and had to research for the final research paper, but overall not a lot of work. There are in class like attendance questions graded on completion which is nice. There are also like 4 group quizzes that are very manageable. Easy class to not do the readings for and also fairly interesting. Not a lot of work outside of class which is good.",
                    "22": "TAKE THIS CLASS. IT WILL ROCK YOUR WORLD. I learned so much from class and I wish I had taken it earlier. The main form of grading is participation, group quiz, and a research paper. It super chill.",
                    "23": "This is an excellent course! It is probably one of the most interesting classes I have taken here and I think it should be a psychology requirement. Prof. Mesghina   is one of the best professors I have ever had. She is not only incredibly engaging, but she is incredibly kind and cares so much about the course. If you can, TAKE THIS CLASS",
                    "24": "I LOVE PROF. she is the best prof in the psychology department at Northwestern. The content is not really related to culture. Grades are based on final papers and quizzes.",
                    "25": "Dr. Mesghina is a fantastic lecturer who can engage students through her knowledge and expertise along with her humor and curiosity about our experiences. She is incredibly qualified as a lecturer (regardless of topic in my opinion) and equally qualified in leading discussions regarding culture, race, and identity. If you can, take a class with her. You'll find a side to psychology at this school that is refreshing and seems to address a lot of the shortcomings of traditional psychology classes and concepts.",
                    "26": "PLEASE TAKE THIS INFORMATIVE AND AMAZING COURSE! Prof Mesghina really helped me reconsider the status quo within general psychology and society that people take for granted and assume is normal when there in fact are underlying bias and assumptions that shouldn't be overlooked. This is an amazing class for anyone who's interested in unpacking the nature of psychology and investigating existing societal inequalities.",
                    "27": "best psych class i've taken at NU. Prof is awesome and friendly, and course does a lot to make you a more well informed and thoughtful person generally",
                    "28": "This class is super interesting. The readings are all very engaging and I didn't feel like any of them were repetitive or unnecessary. I learned something with every reading and every lecture, and the information that we learned in class is super useful and interesting in day–to–day life.",
                    "29": "LOVED THIS CLASS! I highly recommend this class to anyone. I barely knew anything about cultural psych prior to this class,  but now I have a new understanding of how culture impacts everything. Prof Mesghina is great!",
                    "30": "This course was eye–opening! It has changed my entire view on the field of psychology and definitely for the better. Professor Mesghina is just the best and she keeps lectures so engaging. I enjoyed the course content and I definitely recommend that all psych majors take this class! The readings are really interesting and I actually looked forward to doing them! Also, the quarter long research project was great because we were able to research what we wanted and apply the concepts we learned from class. It was intimidating at first, but I really appreciated having parts of the paper due throughout the quarter because it definitely kept me on track. I will miss this class so much, but I look forward to applying what I learned within my future career!",
                    "31": "This course was amazing! Professor Mesghina is a great lecturer, and she's really engaging in the class. The quizzes were very fair and not too stressful, and the final paper was also very doable. The final paper is completed over parts throughout the course of the quarter. I absolutely recommend this class if you can take it. The material is very interesting, and the class isn't very time consuming.",
                    "32": "Took this class as theme requirement for cog sci. Interesting and manageable. Bi–weekly group quizzes, class participation (like basically attendance) and one final paper worth a lot of your grade.",
                    "33": "This has been my favorite psych class that I’ve taken at Northwestern! Love Professor Mesghina! Most of the content is super interesting and really makes you think about the way much of psych research is flawed.",
                    "34": "I would recommend this class to literally everybody! Professor Mesghina is so approachable, funny, intellectual and really interested in listening to her students' perspectives. The readings for this class were really interesting, although I never got around to doing them, she discusses them thoroughly enough in class so that I was able to be well prepared for the quizzes. The quizzes are like 25 mcq questions on canvas that you work on with a group, the mcq require some thinking but are fun to do. Professor Mesghina listened to our feedback that there wasn't enough time allocated for the first quiz so ultimately increased the time limit by a lot for the subsequent quizzes. Around 35% of our grade in this class is from in–class exercises to boost participation, but you can drop two classes' worth of in–class exercises without any penalty and I think regardless of the in–class exercises people would show up because of how interesting the course content is. You learn so much about how to critically evaluate psychological studies and theories from a non–dominant point of view, and how cultural psychology is NOT cross–cultural psychology.",
                    "35": "This course is absolutely amazing and I think that everyone should take this with Mesghina. She is an amazing professor and this class actually was jaw dropping at times. You basically just have 4 quizzes about lecture content (you can drop one) and a final research paper that you can pick the topic yourself. I highly highly recommend taking this class",
                    "36": "This course is great!!! Prof is super engaging, readings are interesting, and workload isn't too bad. Between 2–5 readings per week, a quiz on the readings biweekly, attendance, and a final paper. Material is widely applicable and a great perspective on psychology as a field if you haven't thought about it critically before. Would 1000% recommend to psych/socio majors. If you're in SESP, some of it is repeated from other courses, but there's enough difference as well that it makes it worthwhile. There was a bit of a learning curve with the quizzes (they started out rlly hard for no reason? like even having read the material and been to every lecture, I was getting 12/15) but they were better towards the end of the course.  Wouldn't let that deter you though–– she drops your lowest quiz score",
                    "37": "Pretty solid Psychology class. Tests were take home and some papers you have to right but overall not too bad.",
                    "38": "This class was the BEST class I've ever taken at Northwestern!!! The discussions about psychopathology have truly changed my mindset about it forever, and every discussion stretches your mind in the best way! A must–take class if you're a psych major!!",
                    "39": "Low stress course, except the final paper that is 8–12 pages minimum on your own research project. Throughout the quarter though, you create the proposal and outline which can make starting the paper a little less daunting, and you are given feedback on the proposal and outline before you begin writing. The material learned in class is not directly relevant to everyone's paper, so the readings and lecture material are important mostly for the quizzes that are every 2 weeks. Professor is amazing, super entertaining and explains everything well, and the 80–minute class flies by. Incredible course, you learn so much, and it is much more interesting than you would anticipate it to be.",
                    "40": "Professor Mesghina is AMAZING. She's such a sweet person, very well informed, and extremely relatable. She made everything so digestible, and her feedback is extremely thorough and helpful. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!",
                    "41": "I LOVED THIS COURSE AND PROF MESGHINA. TAKE A CLASS WITH HER MOST DEFINITELY. The content is super interesting, the lectures are fun, and prof Mesghina is the absolute best. I learned so much in this course. The readings are interesting and are often decently short.  The grading is fair and rather spread out so you can definitely get an A without too much stress. I genuinely enjoyed the final project in a way I wasn't anticipating. This course is great.",
                    "42": "Essential course for anyone studying psych. Will change your perspective. Manageable workload",
                    "43": "This course was super interesting and in my opinion critical for all psych majors to take! The professor was awesome and great at connecting the material to real–world examples. The quizzes were a little tricky at times but manageable, and the professor was very fair about grading!",
                    "44": "I can't emphasize it enough, TAKE THIS CLAS!!!! Cultural Psych was hands–down the best class I've ever taken at Northwestern, and Professor Mesghina is the best professor I've had at Northwestern. As a psych major, I would argue that this is THE most important class you could take at Northwestern if you are planning on pursuing psych–related fields and work post–undergrad.",
                    "45": "This was so interesting – the in–class exercises were surprisingly fun, and the assignments are really straightforward. I wasn’t stressed or worried about my grade, and I learned a lot",
                    "46": "This is an incredible class to take whether or not you're studying psychology, you'll learn a lot and seriously will change the way you think about culture in your everyday life in some really cool ways. Professor Mesghina is amazing and the lectures are really interesting and fun!",
                    "47": "I really liked this class (apart from the 8–12 page research paper we had to write, but I'm a person who *dreads* writing research papers). I learned a lot about the new topic of cultural psychology and it just makes sense, it fills in the missing information from existing studies. I'll read research papers from other classes and be thinking about marked vs unmarked participants and home–field advantage in those papers. I also really liked how open and cool she was with us. I think she's Gen Z and it made the class so much more enjoyable when you can laugh/point things out with your professor about the same things you're thinking about. It was so refreshing being taught by a first–generation WOC because (at least for me) it made it easier to understand the material and think deeper about my own experience. She always wore cool outfits, if she had an IG page of just her OOTD, I would follow.",
                    "48": "As with all psychology classes as a psychology major, I highly recommend this course but be ready to put the work in. As with many psychology classes, they are not necessarily the easiest but naturally very interesting. The course content and material is very interesting and Professor Mesghina communicates it all in an engaging manner. I really enjoyed the breakdown of the final project into smaller assignments, so by the time you write your final paper a lot of the material is already written out for you to reference and use. My only slight caveat is to beware of the quizzes because in the beginning it took me a while to get used to the format and what types of answers Professor Mesghina is looking for. However once you get the hang of it, it gets progressively easier in terms of getting used to the format and the course material itself becomes more digestible. Ultimately, highly recommend this course, it was more interesting than your typical psychology course.",
                    "49": "Pretty good course, very thought provoking if cultural differences and things like that are something you're interested in otherwise it can be a bit difficult if you're not really interested in the ideas presented",
                    "50": "I loved this course!! The way Prof Mesghina teaches is so interesting, and it made me excited to go to class. The class grade consisted of 4 quizzes (you can drop 1), participation points, and assignments for the final paper on throughout the quarter. If you follow the rubric of the assignments, you should be more than fine. As someone with immigrant parents, this class was so cool because I was able to see the effects of culture on psychology in my own life. I would highly recommend!",
                    "51": "prof Mesghina is one of the best professors I've had at NU, and definitely the best within the Psych dept. highly engaging lectures that are applicable even outside of the classroom, and she possesses a strong passion for cultural psych. each class involves talking with those around you, and the quizzes encourage collaboration too, so i would suggest taking w friends if possible. either way, definitely a class worth taking and especially with one of the most engaging/passionate profs at NU",
                    "52": "Overall, this was an easy class. You have four open–note quizzes and a final essay. You get to drop one of the quiz scores. The quizzes are kind of hard, but you can collaborate with other people to work on them. If you read the materials assigned, you will get good scores. The classes were not very interesting. The instructor gave us around 30 minutes for group discussions every class. We only have one or two readings assigned for each class; I don't know how we could talk about it for 30 minutes.",
                    "53": "This has been the best class I have taken during my time at Northwestern. Professor Mesghina is an incredibly captivating and passionate professor, and she chose super interesting readings that were not time consuming! It is always a pleasure attending her lectures. My perspective on psychological research and what \"good\" science entails has undoubtedly changed after taking this course. If research is something you are interested in pursuing as a future career, I could not recommend this class more. It really helped me to think critically about what my own biases as a researcher are and how the field should push towards considering the cultural context.",
                    "54": "INCREDIBLE CLASS! Really stimulated my critical thinking abilities and has changed the way I view psychology research. It covers a lot of important topics of racism and Westernisation in psychology. It really critically examines different psychology areas, the readings are all really interesting although can be dense. We had fortnightly quizzes that we did in groups that could be challenging but really good. And we had a research project that we worked on independently on any topic of interest. I love Professor Mesghina, she is so so special. She really is advocating for all her students always.",
                    "55": "This course is so interesting and I love Prof Mesghina. Class is always engaging and thought provoking. I also found the readings to be very interesting. The quizzes were take home and you can collaborate on them, but a lot of the questions/answers were worded in a way that didn't make the most sense. However, going to class and the final paper is weighed heavier than the quizzes, so your grade will be fine. Overall, I would recommend this class.",
                    "56": "this is a great class. it's such an interesting perspective on psychology that I think everyone should have exposure to. I would imagine that this class is probably fairly unique to Northwestern, so everyone should take this class if they can. professor Mesghina is genuinely the best, she's incredibly intelligent and also really funny and knows how to relate to her audience. it's really impressive how well she is able to put the different readings in conversation with each other and build off of foundational concepts. you really need to be comfortable with the readings, since there are 4 quizzes (which are take–home, collaborative, and open–note) that require you to apply your understanding of them. we did go over them in class but you still need to read them, but they're interesting so it doesn't feel annoying to do them. you also get to drop your lowest quiz grade so it's okay if you miss or do really bad on one. the only thing I didn't like so much was the final paper, it is a bit complicated and requires A LOT of sources. if you're concerned about your topic, arguments, sources, etc or are just confused in general, you should definitely go to the office hours of who is grading your paper (either prof Mesghina or a TA), because they can help you work things out in a way that is consistent with the guidelines of the paper. we also submitted parts of the paper in increments throughout the quarter (proposal, outline, final), so you do have opportunities to get feedback on your work. but honestly even though the paper was difficult it is absolutely worth it to take this class. not only is it interesting on its own, but it will also help you bring a new perspective into really any social science–related field (research, law, poly sci, business, etc)."

Class is really fun and engaging, you learn a lot and get to apply a lot of the concepts immediately.  Pop quizzes on the readings, final presentation you work on throughout the quarter, and two small group assignments throughout. Good course, I would take this for a distro or for the theme for cog sci majors.",
                    "2": "I needed this course for a distro requirement, but I am so glad I took it because it taught me how to present better and work with data in some really useful tools (like Excel and Tablaeu). These are SUPER nice on your resume too!",
                    "3": "One of the most disorganized classes I've taken at Northwestern. Grading was often unclear and harsh for no reason. A lot of the rules were not flexible at all. You'd have to put in a lot of time doing \"busy work,\" and it felt like I was back in high school again. I was very attentive in class and never missed a single class but was still confused when completing the assignments sometimes. That being said, I liked that we got to learn Tableau and redesign slides. It's definitely not an easy A, but if you want to learn more about data visualization, this class is probably for you.",
                    "4": "This class is interesting and Prof Franconeri is really engaging. However, this class is somewhat unorganized and I found it difficult to keep track of assignments due to the confusing Canvas and syllabus pages. There's a lot of group work so it's a toss up depending on the group you get.",
                    "5": "THIS CLASS IS AWESOME!! Going into the class I wasn't expecting anything too great, especially since the name of the course kind of sounds boring. However, this has shaped up to be one of my fav classes. It's all about the art of persuasion and giving presentations in the most compelling way possible. I'm so beyond sure that lessons I learned in this class will be applicable to any career path I choose to pursue. On top of all that the class is so easy. There are various group assignments that don't take up too much time. If you do the work and participate the class is a sure bet. Franconeri is really nice and super intresting, which is esp important in a 3 hour class. Time always flew by...however the 5–8 was kind of annoying....overall worth it though.",
                    "6": "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Literally learned nothing. Waste of 3 hrs every week. The classes were way too long and dry and attendance is mandatory plus you literally learn nothing. Lots of random busy work which sometimes surprisingly gets a lot actually, most of it is group work and with vague instructions. Grading is all over the place, I still have no idea if I'm getting an A or a B at this point. I wish I never took this class and wasted so much time.",
                    "7": "Take this class with Professor Franconeri!! The material you learn is applicable to most if not all jobs, and I can't sit through a presentation anymore without thinking about the concepts we learned in class.",
                    "8": "I really enjoyed this course. Professor Franconeri was really engaging which is, in my opinion, the most important quality in a professor teaching a three hour long night class. The readings were interesting and there were tons of guest lecturers who were all really nice and had interesting perspectives on the material being taught and how it related to their life.  One thing to note is that most of the work is group work,  so while I did find all of the assignments useful to my understanding, what you're able to gain from them is somewhat dependent on who you're assigned to work with. Also all of the deadlines are at 5 pm the day before class and I got tripped up by that a few times.",
                    "9": "Great class, Franceroni can lecture very well, doesn't feel like three hours. considering it's a 1–credit class, the workload is very manageable.",

                    "13": "I wouldn't consider this an easy A course at all because it was very hard to get 100s on assignments. Also, it was often unclear how to do well on certain assignments. Overall, the professor was nice and the workload was very manageable.",
                    "14": "I thought that professor Franconeri was the most engaging professor I’ve had here. He made three hour lectures fly by and was truly a joy to learn from. I thought that the class was a bit disorganized, but the intrigue made up for this. Not a ton of work either",
                    "15": "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! It made me want to go into consulting a little bit if I'm being honest. The 3hr class time was a little crazy but it wasn't my first 3hr class and it sadly won't be my last so don't let that stop you from taking this course. There are informative guest speakers and tutorials on Excel and Tableau that will serve you later in life. Prof Franconeri is also very engaging and kind. My only complaint is that the pop quizzes felt like they were loosely based on the actual content of the readings. We got a lot of questions pertaining to the graphics on the readings or the opinions of the author more than what was actually written in the text. Otherwise, great class! As a super super busy engineering major I found this class to be light comparatively, and it can count toward your theme!",
                    "16": "This class was overall really entertaining. Professor Franconeri’s enthusiasm always made the 3 hour evening class feel like it was only one hour long! He teaches so many valuable things about data visualization and also hands out notes and posts lecture slides so you don’t need to take notes in class.  Make sure to do the weekly readings as there are a few pop quizzes. There are also quite a few mini assignments for this class. Some of them are group work so make sure to plan ahead with your group. Grading can be a little harsh for assignments thet are graded in comparison to your peers, but overall is fair. Participation is also a big part of the grade, but as long as you’re there for attendance every class, you should be fine. Altogether though, a great class for people who will need to make presentations in the future. Seems pretty applicable to business and research.",
                    "17": "This class was a lot more fun and interesting than I initially thought going into it, and it's definitely a valuable class to take. Professor Franconeri is great and the guest lectures were awesome. The assignments are hard to keep track of because they're assigned at what feels like arbitrary dates but Franconeri sends email updates about deadlines.",
                    "18": "Franconeri is a great prof, and classes were pretty engaging despite being three hours. Some of the projects do take a little time and brainstorming, but the first half of the quarter is really fun and chill. The grading is a bit harsh, in the way that you almost never get 100% on the assignments, but you usually won't do too bad either. Not a bad class, would take if you're interested in this stuff and have free time",
                    "19": "I loved this course a lot. Even though it was 3 hours, it was super engaging, the content was super applicable to any field you'll go into, and the textbook &amp; materials used to teach were super good. Apart from teaching you how to be a better graphic designer, this class teaches you Excel &amp; Tableau, which are things that are helpful to know regardless of what career you're pursuing. <br><br>I would say there's a lot of group work though &amp; you are matched randomly, so if you like doing things independently, this may not be the class for you. But other than that all focus is put on homework (no exams) &amp; pop quizzes (based on the readings –– but they are super interesting anyways so). Take this class, you won't regret it!",
                    "20": "If you are taking a statistics course, or any course that really deals with a lot of data, I highly reccomend this course. If you need to make presentations a lot this is a very beneficial class. Bascially, you'll learn how to make effective data visualizations and also powerpoint presentations that don't immediately put the audience to sleep.",
                    "21": "Very helpful in learning how to make an engaging presentation deck. Loved when we applied cognitive science ideas to explain why certain techniques are effective (ie: 3–4 items in Short term memory max, eyes filter for color easily) so I wish we did this more! Professor Franconeri is a great professor, so definitely recommend taking it with him.",
                    "22": "Class is very very long and you often need to eat dinner in class. Assignments are very random and do not follow the syllabus. TA grades very harshly and professor does not really get involved in the grading process, so your grades are in the hands of the TAs.",
                    "23": "PowerPoint class. This class is insanely easy, but beware, they grade unusually harsh. It's a large lecture based class and they genuinely expect participation out of every student which is weird.  You do learn some good work place applicable skills though, like info about Excel, Tableau, and presenting data in general.",
                    "24": "I actually really really enjoyed this class! Prof Franconeri is one of the best at NU... He's funny, relatable, and doesn't take the class to seriously. He and the TAs are also great at providing feedback. However, the grading is really weird. They take off decimal points for seemingly no reason which I didn't like. The guest speakers are so cool and great opportunities to learn about data and potential career paths. This is the most applicable class (to the real–world) that I have ever taken. It should totally be a BIP requirement imo because it deals with making slides and effectively displaying data.",
                    "25": "I really loved this class in terms of everything I learned, probably one of the most valuable classes in terms of learning tangible skills. Grading is honestly not very transparent or very generous which is my only complaint. Lectures were 3 hours but didn’t feel like it.",
                    "26": "The class was generally good. There were a lot of small projects and groups that got confusing. The TA also graded the assignment very slowly so you don't know where you stand in terms of grade. If you get a bad group then your grade will drop quite a bit.",
                    "27": "It was a good course, taught me how to organize information well and present it well. The professor was engaging in the class. However, grading was NOT clear as well as participation grades too. They seem to randomly grade you on participation as well as other assignments – often using peer feedback which wasn't good. You only get your grade the last week of the quarter. I did enjoy the guest lectures though.",
                    "28": "This class is so fun honestly. Prof Franconeri is a really engaging lecturer and he gives a lot of class time to do workshops (aka class time to do the homework). There is a lot of group work, but really it's not so bad. He listens to the class too, like at the beginning he asked us if we would rather have one group or multiple groups and just did what we voted for. He does take attendance which was kind of annoying but understandable. My biggest warning for this class is that it felt very heavy on the data side of things and less on the idea sides. Personally I took it for the idea side and, while I would still recommend it as an easy and interesting class, we did a lot more data stuff than I would have liked.",
                    "29": "This was an incredible class! I've recommended it to so many of my friends. Not only is it useful if you're working on presenting research or in the stem field, it's also useful for people in any field ––– I'm a journalism major, and this class genuinely made me a better writer. You learn how to make nice looking power points (which I had a lot of fun with), and hear from some really cool guest speakers (my favorites were the data journalists). There can be a bit of busy work at times ––– we often had to fill out a lot of peer presentation critique forms in very specific ways, but I still think this class was very worthwhile. Make sure you do the readings, too, if you take this class ––– the reading quizzes can catch you off guard!",
                    "30": "I was expecting a pretty fun and interactive course and this course is exactly what I expected. Very fun content and topics.",
                    "31": "there are no rubrics provided, so grading can feel arbitrary and it is hard to know what you need to do to achieve a high grade. the guest stars were amazing.",
                    "32": "This class is amazing. The professor is really easy to pay attention to as he makes jokes and class is very engaging. I learned so much and think about the content every time I look at any presentation now. The group work sometimes sucked because you can't choose who you're with, and the grading was really nit–picky, yet still not hard to get an A, just like 4.85/5 would be an example grade? Anyways I really recommend this class for anyone.",
                    "33": "A fun and engaging course that will teach you a lot about presenting! Professor Franconeri is hilarious and is an expert on the topic as someone who is currently leading a lab researching the psychology of presenting ideas. The TAs were great and provided structural support for the course. The three hour chunk was not bad besides being in the evening. Groupwork was challenging but overall not super time consuming.",
                    "34": "The course material is great, and it has already proven quite useful when designing presentations. However, I do feel that the course is a bit disorganized overall, and the Tuesday 5:00PM due dates were sometimes a bit difficult to remember.  Often times I felt lost in what needed to get done for each class, especially when additional readings included in pop quizzes were distributed in Canvas announcements and not shown on the syllabus. So, while the course is great conceptually, I believe it could benefit from better organization to help students feel a bit less lost.",
                    "35": "Okay, so about a week ago I would've said this is a \"must take at NU\", but its a bit more than that. This course is definitely super interesting, very laid back, and requires almost no outside work apart from a few readings (you get quizzed on them, but the quizzes are extremely doable even if you majorly skim and just get main points. Trust me. I suck at reading, and this was the chillest thing ever), some form submissions (yes this was HW sometimes) and a few group projects. There is also one major group project throughout, but its also nothing crazy (just a 5 min powerpoint that you perfect). The 3 hour meeting times also go by pretty fast since theres usually a lot of interaction, and overall Franconeri is the GOAT of enthusiasm.<br><br>HOWEVER, the grading in this class is, for lack of a nicer word, insane. There are zero rubrics, and everything is graded very arbitrarily. For example, I got a 4.38 / 5 on a  peer review. No feedback, no rubic. And it was presented as a completion grade. How was that number created? What was I supposed to do, write more? So theres little things like that add up and get annoying. An A and A– are still very doable, it's just the grading is a lot more arbitrary than you first expect.<br><br>THE MOST ANNOYING thing however is the participation grade. On the first day, Franconeri made a side comment about \"talking at least 3 times\", but presented it as more of a suggestion. After all, the comment was never brought up again, never encouraged again, and its not like they know my name anyways, right? It's not like Franconeri and the TA's secretly know all 50 or something students' names and are tracking us all quarter, right? So at the end of the quarter, they send us the participation grade formula, which shows that they not only were tracking us the whole time, but that we had to talk FOUR times in order to get a 100%, otherwise you get an 80% just for showing up. And if they caught you doing smth else on their computer, they take off more points. Which is a bit ridiculous they did all this behind our backs, without telling us. They never mentioned that they would be counting nor did they every encourage to \"talk at least 3 times\" apart from one side comment on the first day (which, by the way, it ended up being 4 times). Also, its one thing to simply say \"hey guys, please don't fool around on your laptops, or else we may deduct participation points\", because then everyone gets the message, and everyone in class will actually pay attention. Its another thing to never say anything and just secretly track us and then be like \"guess what!\".<br><br>Again, even with all this, an A and A– are very doable. And the content is very very interesting, and as a data science major I learned a lot more about psychological/cognitive effects than I previously thought about and feel a lot more knowledgeable about how to present data so that it sticks in peoples brains. I think I just needed to get that grading shenanigans thing off my chest, really."

                    "1": "great class!! prof engeln is a super engaging lecturer, any class you take with her is super fun. the class itself is pretty straightforward in its structure: lectures with some in–class activities, 3 take–home exams, and a super short paper. there's also readings but they are super manageable and always interesting. i will say having work due the sunday night after thanksgiving break was a bit soul crushing but engeln is such a good prof i’ll forgive her for that",
                    "2": "Take this class! Professor Engeln is as amazing of a lecturer and professor as everyone says she is! I feel like other psychology classes at Northwestern rarely focus on gender differences, so this class added a new perspective to content I'd learned previously. The workload consists of few articles each class, 3 take–home exams, and an op–ed paper on a topic of your choice. As long as you're attending lecture (which I always looked forward to) and taking notes, the class is very manageable. Highly recommend!",
                    "3": "The course dived into major topics on sex and gender differences and constantly made me reflect on myself and the stereotypes that I once held. Renee is so good at explaining complicated methodology and research, and I enjoy all the scholarly debates on theories and empirical studies that we talked about! A very interesting and solid class!",
                    "4": "This class rocks and so does Renee. The lectures get better as the quarter goes on and I really learned so much –– definitely a must–take!",
                    "5": "This is truly one of the best courses I’ve taken at Northwestern!! It really got me thinking of my own thoughts and biases and seeing how they compared to the science of gender differences. I am someone who struggles to do readings for classes, but I read every single assigned article for this class because the content was all so fascinating. In fact, it was so fascinating that there were many times when I found myself talking about the class and readings to my non–psych friends to see what they thought. Overall, I feel like I learned more about myself and the world in general by taking this course.<br><br>The class was also very low–stress. There were readings but none of them were super long (and once again, super interesting so not hard to get through at all), three non–cumulative take–home exams, and a short final paper where you could write about anything you want.<br><br>Prof. Engeln has expressed she might not want to teach this course in the future, but I really hope she does because I loved it!!",
                    "6": "This course was really interesting– it wasn't necessarily what I expected by I love renee. What I really appreciate about her is I respect her assignments. It's definitely a lot of work and the exams can absolutely be shortened but she has you apply the concepts you learn in a way that is actually beneficial for learning, not just regurgitating. It requires you to think deeply and it was a meaningful way to learn. I wouldn't recommend it if you have a crazy workload in other classes because the take home exams will take a long time and you can't leave them until the last minute but overall I'd really recommend the class and renee obviously she's the best.",
                    "7": "This is a great class to take your final year if you can get in as it can be low stress if you manage your time well. Renee is absolutely lovely and the classes are always enjoyable. You have 3 take–home exams that you have a week for – start early and do it gradually as it can take more than a day if you're being picky about your answers. In class, take a lot of notes as not a lot is put up on the slides and things she says will turn up on the exams. You also have a paper which is fun as it's about your interests. Renee is extremely flexible and understanding of the fact we may have other time constraints – do take this class with her if you can.",
                    "8": "This class was great! Renee does a great job of stimulating your interest in the topic and encouraging conversations/debates in the class.",
                    "9": "This class was so interesting and well–taught, I thoroughly enjoyed the content and class culture. We did in–class discussions and activities that made the class very engaging and tight–knit. Some of the readings were truly fascinating and gave me a greater appreciation for research and methods. Professor Engeln always knew if we were stressed and was flexible enough to move things around in the schedule when needed.",
                    "10": "Take this course!!! One of the best courses I've taken at Northwestern, it was so interesting while also having a very manageable workload. Professor Engeln was incredible, definitely take a class with her if you can. Probably my favorite prof I've had a NU, she's an amazing lecturer and really made me interested and engaged in all the topics. She's such a kind and genuine person as well and she really made this class so interesting and so fun."

                    "1": "Professor Mroczek is awesome! You can tell that he is super passionate about the material. The assignments are very manageable, just two 10 page papers and 2 quizzes, and grading is very fair.  Would definitely recommend this class.",
                    "2": "This course was absolutely amazing! Very eye opening in terms of changing habits to promote longevity, and the material was very stimulating.",
                    "3": "It was a pretty chill class with a very lovely Prof. Lectures are super dry and boring, but you don't have to do much work other than two long papers and two in–class quizzes. Take if you're interested in learning how adults age",
                    "4": "The course included very interesting material about aging. Certain topics are kinda common sense (e.g. \"chronological\" vs. \"biological\" age) especially if you've been taking other psychology or biology courses. My favorite part of the course were the two 8–10 page papers we had to write. The first is a \"Life Projection Paper\" where you predict how your life will play out up until your death. The second is a \"Life Review Paper\" where you interview someone 65+ and write about their comprehensive life story. I found both assignments to be incredibly valuable and fun. You also have two short quizzes that take around 30 minutes each. Overall, this course is interesting, pretty easy, and fun! While the professor is very very kind and supportive, he does tend to go on tangents so it can be a little difficult to pay attention in class.",
                    "5": "prof mroczek is a great lecturer, very passionate. I haven't taken a psych class before and just took this because it sounded interesting, and it was a little hard to care about some of the topics but I still enjoyed listening to the lectures. very generous grader for the two papers, and the two quizzes were free response but everything was from the slides",
                    "6": "I really enjoyed this course! Professor Mroczek is really passionate about teaching the material, and he communicates the content really well. Although the grading scale looks pretty intimidating (A is at least a 96), doing well in this course isn't that challenging. There are only two short quizzes that are pretty easy, so long as you review the content in the lecture slides beforehand. There are also two papers that take a lot of time to finish since they both must be about 8–10 pages long, but as long as you start working on them in advance and meet all of the necessary criteria, you should be fine. Overall, I would definitely recommend taking this course!",
                    "7": "Take this class!! It is absolutely amazing! Prof. Mroczek is the funniest guy, a fantastic lecturer, and makes the class so interesting. The whole class is 2 quizzes and 2 8–10 page papers that are actually enjoyable to write. I was skeptical when I heard people say that before, but it definitely is true. It is a very low stress course as well and is unlike any other psych class I have taken at Northwestern because it actually discusses aging into adulthood while most other classes focus on adolescence or childhood. If you have the chance, take this course. Even if you do not take it for any reason, it was such a good class and really enjoyable.",
                    "8": "Classes were interesting and not mandatory but the two quizzes are based off of the class material, so it doesn't hurt to go. The material was interesting and Professor Mroczak is super passionate about this subject. The quizzes were 5 questions which means missing one can really jeopardize your grades, but the papers are worth more and are pretty nice for reflecting on your life.",
                    "9": "Would recommend the class, there isn't a lot of work besides the quizzes and paper, but they're relatively easy. You also learn a good bit about the factors that lead to aging. The professor is also really nice.",
                    "10": "The essays are meaningful.",
                    "11": "This was a great class and Dr. Mroczek is an amazing professor! The class is made up of 2 quizzes and 2 8–10 page papers. All the assignments are pretty much due towards the end of the quarter which made the class a bit stressful during that time, so definitely try to get ahead on the assignments. Dr. Mroczek is also super understanding, supportive, and engaging.",
                    "12": "Dr. Mroczek is awesome and this class was fantastic. Learned so much, not too big a time commitment.",
                    "13": "Mroczek rules. He wants people to ask questions and be interested in the material. Class was very casual. The 2 papers were a little daunting to get started but were really interesting and I feel like I personally gained something from writing them. The 2 quizzes were very straightforward. Take this if you can",
                    "14": "A really interesting class and the professor is so sweet! The papers are kind of fun to write and the exams are 5–6 questions from the slides. The exams are memory based and not difficult. Overall, I would really recommend this class I learned a lot and it was not very hard.",
                    "15": "Mroczek is amazing! He's incredibly friendly and responsive with answering questions in class. I found the class to be very manageable– there were just 2 papers and 2 quizzes. If you go over the slides and pay attention you should be able to do well on the quizzes, they were just five open–ended questions that asked general concept questions. I really enjoyed doing the papers! The first one asks you to project the future of your life and the second one asks you to interview an older adult and analyze their life (we didn't get the second paper back yet but the first one was graded very generously). Take this class!",
                    "16": "This class was awesome, would highly recommend! The grade is based fully on two 8–10 page papers and two 5–question short answer quizzes, so the actual week–to–week workload was super manageable. I found the course content incredibly interesting and relevant, and the two papers were a really fun way to apply that content knowledge to real life (one paper asked you to predict the course of the rest of your life based on research findings, and the other asked you to interview an older adult about their life). Prof. Mroczek is clearly so knowledgeable and passionate about this subject and really encouraged us to ask questions and share our reactions to what we learned.  I'll take what I learned in this class with me through life — would definitely recommend this to psych majors and non–psych majors alike!",
                    "17": "This was a great course with a nice blend of biology and psychology. I would recommend to anyone in neuroscience or psychology!",
                    "18": "The only work you have to do for this course is 2, double–spaced, 8–10 page papers. Sounds like a lot, right? But the first is \"What does the rest of your life look like\" and is mostly creative, and the second is \"Interview someone over the age of 65 and summarize their life story.\" Super chill, I think everyone I know went WAY over the limit just to finish their thoughts. There's 2 tests as well, but they are 5 short–answer questions taken from the VERY main ideas of the course. Like literally, its a breeze if you study a bit. I think my friend and I guessed 4 out of the 5 questions on the final. It's that clear, prof just doesn't care about tricking you in the slightest. Lectures are super fun, its mostly Mroczek going on rants about all the crazy stuff he knows and you asking whatever questions you have about the topics because you're so interested. Slides can be a lot, but if you focus on the main ideas, its chill. Readings each week were really interesting, and not too much if you are willing to skim (they're all research papers, so just read abstract, skim intro, skim discussion, read conclusion and you're chillin). Readings aren't even necessary for the course, most people didn't do a single one. I found them interesting enough to read for the sake of it, though. Be prepared to be talked at a lot, and come in with some interest and curiousity, and this will be a super fun, chill class.",
                    "19": "I absolutely loved the content and the professor. I want to study aging as my career now, this is how much I loved this class!",
                    "20": "Professor Mroczek is super kind and understanding, and is clearly really interested in what he teaches! This course was interesting and so applicable to daily life, and there isn't much work besides two short quizzes and two papers. The two papers were pretty lengthy but not hard, and the second one was really fulfilling and wholesome! I really enjoyed this class!",
                    "21": "Great course, take it with Dr. mroczek he knows what he's doing.  2 essays and 2 midterms and everything is super straightforward.",
                    "22": "I LOVE THIS CLASS. small class and learned so much yet stress–free. Grades are based on presentation, discussion, proposal, and outline.",
                    "23": "discussion posts due every class and one large final project. the posts could be time–consuming, but all the readings are so interesting. professor mesghina is amazing – everyone should take this class to learn more about themselves and the world around them. highly recommend.",
                    "24": "This was a great class! The discussion–based style works really well, since it lets everyone connect the content to their own experiences, which helped me understand course concepts a lot more. Prof. Mesghina is great and always willing to help students. Readings are interesting and very relevant.",
                    "25": "Great class! Bookclub–style classes were super fun and engaging!",
                    "26": "I loved that class. We got to explore so many topics that I already think about on my own. I also loved how discussion–based it is. Professor Mesghina is great",
                    "27": "I loved this course considering that I am not too fond of cognitive psychology! Professor Mesghina is AMAZING, and this class was amazing as well! There was a lot of participation required through discussion posts due before each class (consisted of concise summaries of readings, two implications, and a discussion questions), leading one class discussion, and participating during class, but the environment she created made participation very easy! The final for this class consisted of a group project that incorporating class readings/ideas and our own interests. You work towards this project throughout the quarter, but it does get busier as the quarter comes to an end.",
                    "28": "This class was awesome. Professor Mesghina is genuinely one of the best professors I've had at Northwestern and truly cares about the students in her classes. The course material itself is super interesting and she makes an effort to cover a wide range of information under the topic that students can really connect with. The assignments aren't too bad– discussion posts (321s) for every class that she gives really good and appropriate feedback on, one discussion lead, and a group project. The group project can be either good or bad so choose wisely on who you work with and what you are doing",
                    "29": "This is the best class i have ever taken at northwestern. So interesting and the structure was great. Usually for classes without exams I feel like I don't learn as much, but I remember so much from this course ad learned so much from the practical implications",
                    "30": "I highly recommend this as a 300–level elective for any psych major or minor. Professor Mesghina is an awesome instructor and I actually liked going to class (which is rare for me)! We learned about how intertwined cognition and emotion truly are by exploring a range of topics like advertising and consumer decision–making, elderly people, stereotype threat, academic stress, botox, etc.<br>This class was run like a book club. There were no lectures; every day was a discussion facilitated by 1–2 students, where we talked about the assigned readings (&lt;30 pages). It was actually fun to participate because the readings were engaging and everyone had interesting stories to tell. The class size was small so participating was not intimidating. Even though class was 80 minutes long, the time went by fast.<br>Before each class, we would have to submit discussion points for the assigned readings called 3–2–1’s. They consist of a 3–sentence summary, 2 implications (theoretical and practical), and 1 question. Even though it’s not much writing, the purpose was to be strategic with your words and come to class prepared.<br>Just once, everyone had to lead the class discussion (either with a partner or alone). It was very low–pressure, and all we had to do was briefly summarize the readings for the class and throw out some discussion questions.<br>In the second half of the quarter, we worked on a group final project. It was enjoyable because we could do research on a topic we were actually passionate about. On the last day, each group presented their topics to the class.<br>Grading: 25% participation, 25% 3–2–1’s (written discussion points), 25% discussion lead, 25% final project.",
                    "31": "This is probably one of the best courses I've taken at NU so far. Mesghina is an absolutely amazing professor and the way she de–centers herself to allow for discussion amongst everyone is incredible. Discussions are actually fruitful in this class and the class topics were always super interesting. I learned so much here partly due to the way we were free to take our conversations any way we wished to while also having structure from a designated discussion lead for the day. Loved this class so much.",
                    "32": "The course gives an introduction to R starting with basic programming and descriptive analyses followed by more complicated analyses like regression, factor analysis, mediation, and item response theory. The course was useful in getting to know your way around R, especially using the psych and psychtools packages. The examples we went through in class were helpful to learning and the reference datasets were easily accessible. I found the classes on basic statistics easy to understand, but when it got to more complicated topics, it was a bit harder to grasp because of the speed at which those topics were covered. The organization of the class could also be improved. Sometimes it felt like we were bouncing from topic to topic and it was difficult to keep track of where we were in the course and what we were learning.  I appreciated learning how to create an R Markdown document.",
                    "33": "Very knowledgable, entertaining, and kind.",
                    "34": "Well, this class was… interesting. Basically this class is titled incorrectly. It is NOT an introduction to R class. It’s an advanced statistics course, with some R, where you sit and listen to him talk about this research a few times a week. There was very light homework and a final project, but there just wasn’t a whole lot in this class to start with. Probably should have some coding experience before taking this if you actually want to learn something, but you could definitely pass this class without learning R at all. Most people were so confused they just stopped showing up for the lectures. Wasn’t a fan.",
                    "35": "Although many of the nitty–gritty details of the statistical tests kinda went over my head, the TA (shoutout to Kayla!!) was super helpful at clarifying concepts and helping me debug code! I'm very grateful I took this class since I feel like I could run my own statistical analyses on my own now, or at least I have more awareness of the questions I need to ask to run tests successfully.",
                    "36": "Lectures were really hard to follow; this is not an introductory level course to R, but you will definitely learn a lot even if you don't get most of it.",
                    "37": "I went into this class with not a lot of stats background which I definitely recommend getting before you take the class because he can go over some pretty complicated concepts. The homework isn't too bad, most of them are based on completion which is nice but you still need to learn the concepts for the homework that is graded based on correctness. Overall, I really enjoyed learning in this class because I've never worked with R before and it was super interesting.",
                    "38": "If you really want to learn R, this is a decent class to take. The more you practice, the better you get. However, Professor Revelle is not a great teacher. The lectures often felt disorganized and sometimes unrelated to the weekly assignments we were doing. There seemed to be a disconnect between the prof and TA. Once Prof Revelle didn't even know what the homework assignment was and wouldn't have taught us what we needed to complete the assignment if students hadn't asked him to. He also wasn't great at explaining the stats part of the class. With that said, most of the assignments are just completion based and don't take too long, so in terms of grades, this was a very easy class."

The assignments were super vague but not hard.",
                    "6": "I thought understanding similar trends and aspects of entrepreneurs were important and beneficial for learning.",
                    "7": "This course was interesting in thinking about the typical personalities of CEO's and entrepreneurs. It also had reflective writing pieces where you were able to apply what you have learned towards your own personality.",
                    "8": "This class was cool because there was a new guest speaker every class that brought interesting ideas about their story.",
                    "9": "While I received a great grade and did not have to stress too much about this course because the content was simple, I think some of the instruction next quarter needs modications. There was often a lack of clarity in weekly assignments and even the culminating group project. All readings and podcasts were from the same source. The only times the details of the assignments were ever clarified were after they had been handed in and graded in the comments.",
                    "10": "This class was alright. Pretty easy to get an A but the assignments are kind of confusing and open ended.",
                    "11": "Class was a bit disorganized and it was hard to tell what the professor was looking for on assignments because there were little to no instructors/prompts. Besides that, it wasn't that time–consuming or difficult.",
                    "12": "Every assignment is extremely vague and you won't know what you're supposed to do. TA could not give feedback on my paper because even she was unsure how she was supposed to vague. This class sounds very interesting but I honestly didn't learn much. I could have learned all of the content in a few hours. Easy class but wanted it to be more than it was.",
                    "13": "Interesting course material, but the pace could've been faster, and I think we could've incorporated more diverse sources. I enjoyed learning about the Hogan inventories, and this course was helpful for analyzing leaders and company culture, but I wish there were more material outside of the Hogan ones.  I enjoyed the guest speaker part, but it would've been better if we could've asked them questions too. <br>Tackett has good energy, but sometimes her grading system feels quite opaque, as it took a while to get a clear rubric for the papers. The subsequent projects/papers were graded a bit better, but it would've been nice for this course to be more organized. Overall, interesting class, not super time–consuming, energetic professor.",
                    "14": "Somehow I thought this course was going to be about how to become a better leader yourself, but it was more about studying other leaders and leadership boards in existing organizations, and learning about frameworks for analysis.  There were a lot of guest speakers (one per week) but sometimes they didn't provide much interesting or engaging insight. You spend the whole quarter working on a group project that you get auto–assigned to, so hopefully you like the company and your teammates.",
                    "15": "This course was really interesting for the first half but for the second half we spent so much time on the group project that it got a bit monotonous. The content is really interesting and the weekly readings are not difficult – the assignments were also very reflection based and graded quite fairly. I definitely recommend trying to take the class with friends and forming groups with them.",
                    "16": "This course is very easy, very little work. However, it was the first time Professor Tackett was teaching the course and lowkey it kind of felt like she was making it up as she went.  I was also hoping for more entrepreneurship leadership stuff, but we mostly focused on the psychological profile of founders vs CEOs. I was taking this for my entrep minor, but it definitely leaned more psychology especially since Prof Tackett is a psychology professor. If you want a chill low–stakes class though, this class is for you.",
                    "17": "This class is super easy. You won't really learn that much about entrepreneurial leadership beyond personality traits, but its a super easy workload and class. 3 hour classes every week, part lecture part guest speaker. We spent way too much time working on the easiest group projects, but honestly, i didn't complain!",
                    "18": "easy class. material was very repetitive but guest speakers were interesting. chill professor – she’s super passionate which made the content more interesting.",
                    "19": "This class is insanely chill. There are very few guidelines, deadlines, or expectations. Throughout the quarter you work on one main group project which concludes in a 15 minute presentation split between 4–5 people. Other than that there are 3 papers talking about personality tests. I would reccomend the class tho. The content is cool and I like how it brings together two different subjects.",
                    "20": "I think it is noteworthy that this was the first time this class ran, and the professor was out with covid for either 2 or 3 class periods. The class itself was good but a lot of items surrounding the class were not ideal. The class was incredibly disorganized and one of the TAs had no clue what was going on in the class. We only got to start properly learning about halfway through the quarter because of things mentioned above. With that being said, the material was fun and engaging and there was not too much busy work.",
                    "21": "great lectures and discussions!",
                    "22": "easy course, but it seemed a bit all over the place and needs more structure in terms of distinguishing concepts between class periods and the assignments",
                    "23": "This was the worst and most meaningless course aI took at Northwestern. It's academic objective was extremely vague and disorganized. Professor seems nice, but this was the first time she taught the class. There were no rubrics or detailed instructions on how to do the assignments and the assignments themselves were extremely vague. The 3 hour classes seemed to dread on and although it was an interesting topic, the class didn't really explore it. There are so many great PSYCH classes at NU and this one is most likely not worth your time."

H. David Smith is super nice and easy to communicate",

He is very quick to respond to emails and is always willing to help! The class setup includes discussions, 1–2 readings before each class, three homework assignments, a group research project, a presentation, and a final exam. It's a well–balanced workload that challenges you to work with sports analytics. The only downside is that while you get grades for your work, there's not much feedback on why you got a certain grade. It's the only thing that could use a bit of improvement, but overall, it's a manageable course that teaches you a lot about sports and data.",

                    "8": "Overall, a very easygoing and interesting course. Prof HDS enjoys lecturing and tries his best to keep everyone else involved and engaged. The workload is very light, and I appreciated how we were allowed to pick our own directions with the homework assignments and research project. The only thing I disliked was the instructions for the homework were not very specific, making it difficult to make sense of points that were taken off. The final exam was not too bad, as he gave us a study guide with vocab we needed to know. If you take this class because you like sports, you won't be disappointed.",

Lectures are interesting and there's not too many assigments, just some homeworks which are very chill, a final presentation which is also chill, and a final exam, which you do have to prepare for and is a little challenging but nothing bad at all. The content in the class is also very fun if you're into sports. Homework guidelines can be a little unclear at times, however. Also, the grading guidelines for the presentation were also unclear. Overall though, this is a very fun class.",

                    "1": "Overall, a really good overview of the most common statistical tests you’ll see in psychology. As a stats/psych double major, I still learned a lot of new things that weren’t covered closely in my stats classes. The class was very low stress too, which I greatly appreciated. There were weekly HW assignments graded only for completion, a midterm, and a final. Both midterm and final were a bit of a time crunch, but they were open–note and not too bad since Prof. gave us a heads up of what to expect beforehand.<br><br>Also, Prof. Rick is the best!! He’s incredibly kind and understanding and has great jokes!",
                    "2": "I loved this class so much. If you want to do research in psychology, this is a must take.<br><br>Basically, it’s PSYCH 201, but more advanced – This class’ slogan is basically “Hey, remember X from 201? :) Did you *really* understand the logic behind it? How can you *actually* use it?” It’s a crash course on nearly every single major statistics topic you might need to know for analyzing data in psychology (hypothesis testing, regression, t–tests, meta–analyses, ANOVAs, factor analysis, non–parametric methods, etc). You also learn a super easy to use platform called SPSS. <br><br>Professor Rick is one of the best professors I’ve ever had – He did a fantastic job teaching this course. It was a really small class (only 6 of us), but he always made sure everyone was participating and understood things. If you ask for help, he’s super willing. Office hours were a great resource.<br><br>On a normal week, this class was so chill – There are 8 very quick and easy HW assignments, graded for participation. Class was a vibe, and Rick created a zero–stress environment. I wasn’t afraid of getting things wrong or asking questions. <br><br>However, the exams are weighted very very heavily – 30% midterm, 50% final. The final was a ton of pressure for that reason. Both exams were fair (pretty much just what we did in class), but you had to work very quickly to finish everything on time. But, if you take notes, pay attention, and practice a little, you’ll be ok. (Some feedback – Maybe consider lowering the percentage of the class the final is worth to reduce some pressure!)<br><br>The curve is a bit unusual – The top two students in the course set a “reference point” for grading the rest of the class. They get 100%, and every other grade is determined based off of those two students. For example, if the top two students got an average overall grade of a 95%, you need to get an 87.4% or higher to get an A (ie, 92% of the reference point), and so on. Most students did really well for this reason.<br><br>I’m going to miss this class! If you can, take this with Rick :)",
                    "3": "I enjoyed this class a lot (much more than I expected!). It was a great balance of gaining a conceptual understanding of statistical tests and practicing doing those statistical tests using SPSS. I came out of the course feeling much more confident about how to answer different types of research questions and how to interpret results in a systematic way. Professor Zinbarg is an excellent lecturer. He moves through topics in a clear and thoughtful way, and he is always so patient with answering all of our questions! He made complex statistical concepts feel approachable and less intimidating, and he also learned all of the students' names within the first week of classes. I think this is a must–take for anyone who is interested in pursuing research in psychology!",
                    "4": "Take this class if you have any interest in higher degree in Psych/research career!!! Professor ZInbarg provided an incredible stats background both theoretically and in practicality of using SPSS. He wants you to succeed and provided really fair tests/homework (which hw is just completion grade). I learned so so much about SPSS and can see so many practical applications of this class for myself in the future with research.  I had no stats background other than psych stats and this class was still manageable and easy enough to follow along. Professor Zinbarg is great!!"

Quizzes seemed pretty straight forward, we were allowed 2 drops out of the 8. Prof. Beeman is super passionate about the field of cognitive neuroscience and I definitely learned a lot. He wanted to choose papers based on what we were interested in and having an opportunity to present a paper really helped my own presentation skills when it came time to present my own research poster later in the quarter.

                    "0": "Professor Waxman is such a treat to have as a professor. She truly cares about all of her students and wants to see them succeed. She provided a lot of individualized support which made this possible overwhelming class much more doable. I would recommend this for the advanced research psych major requirement!",
                    "1": "What I liked most about this course was that it helped prepared me for graduate school applications! I was able to use writing samples from my project, and since we chose our topics I was able to delve deeper into a topic I hope to study after graduating. I also liked the symposium at the end of the course, it was great practice for future research projects and presentations.",
                    "2": "Please take this class if you like psych research! This is a great class to pursue your interests and Professor Waxman is AWESOME",
                    "3": "Professor Waxman is clearly passionate about the research she does, and emanates it through her teaching. From the start, she trusted and encouraged us to come up with our own research process, offering guidance along the way. Her steadfast confidence in us made this experience even more exciting. It is evident that Professor Waxman's priority is making sure her students are learning the material in a way that resonates with them. I highly recommend this course with her. While it does require some commitment outside of class since you are required to write a research proposal during the quarter, I suggest attending office hours with the professor and scheduling weekly group meetings to ease the workload.",
                    "4": "This was probably my favorite class I've taken at Northwestern. Essentially the class is a long–term group project where you plan and write a research proposal. Taking this while working on a thesis has been incredibly helpful – although I wish I could've taken it sooner.",
                    "5": "I had really high hopes for this class, but it really fell short of my expectations. The subject matter was interesting, but I wouldn't take this class unless you have a really good background in developmental psych because it is difficult to understand the studies on critical periods and development if you don't have a full grasp on this topic (developmental was not necessarily a requirement, but it should be and was treated as such). The fact that there are no grades in the grade book for the entire quarter was also quite stressful, as I didn't know how I stood in the class. I wanted to take a research seminar so that I could learn to write lit reviews and proposals under the mentorship of a professional in the field, but Waxman was not a good mentor for less experienced researchers. She didn't know how to answer basic questions, failed to explain basic components of a lit review and proposal, and gave very minimal support other than revisions with comments that were hard to understand. She's a brilliant researcher, but she doesn't know how to teach. At times, it felt like the only members of the class she taught with respect were those in her lab. The class just didn't feel equitable and I think I could have learned so much more with more organized and supportive instruction.",
                    "6": "It’s a 3 hour class but a lot of classes are used just to give you time to complete the project. There are a lot of presentations, it’s a good class and the grading wasn’t strict but it can still be stressful. Overall, an easy class as long as you do the work",
                    "7": "This class was really lovely.  We mostly focused on group work, which was so much more productive than you would anticipate. My research group were pretty good pals by the end, and we all ‘became experts’ in one specific field.  If you enjoy psychology and research, I would advise you take this class. Professor Waxman is also such an incredible mentor. She is very passionate and knowledgeable. She definitely ensures the class is student–led, and that everyone is included and engaged. Great Row2 class, easy A if you are committed to the work."

The whole class grade is based on discussion posts and two research–related papers in which I used much more independent sources than info I gathered from the class. The structure of the class is a little uneven, and it kind of feels like the professor is touching on a lot of subjects on the surface level rather than going in–depth.",
                    "1": "I had a great experience taking The Emotional Brain. Professor Nusslock does an incredible job of explaining all the material and making the class inclusive for everyone, regardless of their background in Neuroscience. It is discussion–based and includes essays instead of exams, so there is no pressure to memorize information, which I felt really improved my learning experience and allowed me to engage with the material more than I have done in other psychology classes. Overall, I would highly recommend this class!",
                    "2": "Highly recommend! Prof Nusslock is a very kind, understanding, and empathetic guy and I love how interdisciplinary this class is! Combination of psychology, neuroscience, biology, and even philosophy (meditiation &amp; free will &amp; consciousness are discussed)!!! Definitely go to office hours to talk to him about life",
                    "3": "Take this class!!! It's so incredibly interesting and professor nusslock is such a kind person and great lecturer. it's very discussion based and he gets the class involved on such important topics. There are 2 big papers and weekly readings / discussion questions which can be time consuming but you can definitely do well if you put in the time",
                    "4": "Super interesting content! Prof was so engaging– I was always excited for lectures",
                    "5": "Prof. Nusslock is amazing—a very interesting perspective on the brain that focuses on psychological concepts along with basic neuroscience ideas. Highly recommend this class!",
                    "6": "IF YOU TAKE ANY PSYCH CLASS AT NU, PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS. This class by far is the best class I have taken at NU. Professor Nusslock is so kind, interesting, and smart and he genuinely cares so much about his students. The class structure is discussion posts for every class which can get tiring, but there are no exams at all. There are two essays that are work but are not graded harshly by any means. The experience of writing these essays are also awesome as you get to choose any neuro or psych topic to do a deep dive into, which to me was very cool because I got to learn a lot about topics I was very curious about. The biggest draw to this class is the amazing discussions that take place during class and the topics Professor Nusslock introduces that study the neurobiological basis to mood disorders.  I cannot stress more how wonderful this class is and how much you need to take it.  Professor Nusslock is so humble but truly is one of the smartest people I've ever met. I've grown so much from this class and it has made me enjoy being a student. Just take it.",
                    "7": "Overall, pretty interesting course. Professor Nusslock is great and makes the lectures very engaging. I highly recommend taking a course with him if you have the chance. There's only two big papers and 2 weekly discussion posts. The discussion posts felt tedious, but the papers are graded very fairly. A lot of content is covered throughout the course and it is very helpful to have a neuroscience background for this course, but overall you don't necessarily need to understand everything and you definitely don't need to memorize anything to be successful in the course.",
                    "8": "Only two papers, so it’s easy and Robin Nusslock is very nice and a good lecturer. But personally the course felt very disorganized and it didn’t feel like I really learned much. The papers didn’t have to have anything to do with the lectures so if participation wasn’t a factor I could’ve gotten an A without wasting my time at any of the lectures. I was expecting it to be more discussion based but it was mostly the professor talking at us about what seemed like random topics that popped into his head. Also the content was not was I was expecting it to be, it felt very pseudo–sciencey talking about meditation and whatnot in a course that I expected to be more neuroscience focused.",
                    "9": "I loved this class. I always appreciate Professor Nusslock for teaching classes that explain the neuroscience behind psychology, as I think understanding how the brain works internally is very important in the study of psychology and for where the field is headed. Classes were a combination of lecture and discussion. Work for the class was manageable, with readings, 2 discussion questions due for each class, a 6–7 page literature review, and another 6–7 page lit review with an added research proposal for the final. Both papers were on topics of our choice. Aside from the content being extremely important and interesting, Professor Nusslock is an absolute gem. He cares so much about us doing well and inputs information from sources we may not have been familiar with before like Buddhism. Even if he didn't know the answer to our questions, he would try to give us places to look and literature to read. I absolutely recommend taking a class with him if you have the chance. Overall I feel this class is a must–take if you can get into it.",
                    "10": "Great higher level psych class, I wish it had been smaller to allow for better discussion, however, the class was mostly lecture based. With no tests/quizzes, it was hard to f once myself to pay attention sometimes –– but there was no penalty for not paying attention except your own learning. The two papers give you a lot of freedom to research whatever you are interested in (and did not even have to be neuroscience related). Overall, great class, Professor Nusslock is great. Lectures were personal and engaging, highly recommend. I also had no neuroscience background (have not even taken intro to neuro), but did just fine bc there were no tests/quizzes!",
                    "11": "I really like Prof. Nusslock! He is engaged in everything he teaches and always has a good time leading our discussions. I enjoyed the class environment we had.",
                    "12": "I was scared taking this course because I am not a neuroscience major, but professor is super understanding and explains topics very well so it’s easy to understand",
                    "13": "Emotional Brain with Professor Nusslock was an amazing class. Even with little Neuroscience background, I was able to follow along thanks to Professor Nusslock's engaging and detailed lectures. The class covers fascinating topics that I would recommend anyone interested in emotions and their psychological workings to consider taking! The weekly readings and discussion questions were manageable and enjoyable. That being said, the two 6–8 page literature review papers can be a little overwhelming, so it would be a good idea to start working on those early and always consult with Professor Nusslock on any questions and concerns.",
                    "14": "Take this class with Prof. Robin. He is the best.",
                    "15": "Professor Nusslock is awesome and a fun lecturer. Most STEM professors are intense and sometimes unrelatable, but Nusslock makes himself approachable and excites the idea of pursuing academia. The class was pretty straightforward. Two papers and discussion questions. Definitely doable, but the discussion questions are pretty much just busywork. Never addressed in class but take a long time which was a pain. Overall worth taking though",
                    "16": "Great class for upper level research requirement. Professor Nusslock is well respected among psych students for his ability to articulate ideas and engage his students. I would take this class if you have an interest in the emotional brain, or if you struggle to find an interesting class for the upper level requirement. The class requirements are pretty chill too! The professor cares about you and wants to make us as stress free as possible",
                    "17": "This is a great class and Prof. Nusslock is amazing! He is so smart, but also so kind, and really made this class accessible to students that don't have neuroscience backgrounds.  The syllabus also includes a lot of really interesting topics that can be applied to your life. Our class also had the pleasure of having visiting monastics attend for part of the quarter so it was a  truly amazing opportunity to have their insight on topics like morality and compassion. It's a seminar so ask questions and engage if you have the opportunity to take this class!",
                    "18": "The professor is amazing, super supportive. You can learn a lot from the class, though I recommend going into the class with some interest in neuroscience.",
                    "19": "I think this course was interesting! A lot of it was content from intro to neuro, so some content felt repetitive at times, but I think the readings allowed for a new perspective that differed from the content in that class. The midterm paper topics were approved out loud in class which was actually pretty helpful because we were able to get live feedback and suggestions on the kind of research we could look at as we develop our papers. The papers  required a lot of effort, but they were graded fairly and thoughtfully.",
                    "20": "I loved this course. Professor Nusslock is a great lecturer and engaged the class. The readings were not too much but were very informative; there are discussion posts (post two questions about the readings) for every class. There are no exams which makes this class less stressful but just as rewarding. If you're interested in this topic, I'd highly recommend it!",
                    "21": "This was an amazing course! Professor Nusslock is so knowledgeable and wise, and he is very passionate but also humble about what he researches and teaches. The course explores the intersection of neuroscience with emotions, mental health, morality, and free will/consciousness, and I not only learned so much about neuroscience but also wise life lessons. There are two research papers throughout the quarter that need to incorporate ideas from neuroscience but do not have to be related to class material. The lecture materials are not tested but it was still really worth it to engage with all the content!"

                    "0": "I honestly really liked this course. I was scared going into it because of previous CTECs I had read, but I really think you should not be discouraged from them. As a freshman, I was daunted by the first few lectures because it seemed like there was a lot of basic neuro info we were already expected to know, but that ended up not being an issue.  A lot of people seem to take issue with the format of the lecture slides, but I honestly thought they were fine. The professor is really nice and he posts class recordings. I actually ended up not going to a lot of the classes and just reviewed the slides and class recordings from home and took notes on them, and  I was still able to learn all the material. I also found the topics we talked about to be quite interesting. There was basically no work outside of classes which was nice, and the readings were not necessary. We also had an at–home quiz each week, which was a great way to get points. The final is 50% of your grade, but if you review the study questions and take notes throughout the quarter, it truly isn't as daunting as it seems. I originally took this course because it was the only psych class left during registration, but I overall found it to be a decent class and what you would expect from any neuro–focused psych class.",
                    "1": "Not as bad as the other CTECs say. There are weekly quizzes but they are take home so not bad. There are no midterms. Ken Paller chooses pretty interesting topics and he records his lectures. So you can just watch the lectures at home double speed. Most of the work is during the last two weeks of the quarter (the final exam (free response) and a project).",
                    "2": "Although I found course material interesting by the end of the quarter, it’s important to note that 50% of your grade for this course is the final exam. There are weekly quizzes and assignments but the bulk of your grade is one test. This means that you have to hold yourself accountable to keep up with the material on your own. Lecture topics were engaging but the lectures themselves were a little difficult to get through every week. The lecture slides don’t contain all the helpful information. However, when you go over the slides while listening to the class recordings (professor recorded the classes), it’s a little easier. Also, for the final exam you only really need to focus on the lecture (not the textbook). Overall, if you’re SUPER interested in the topic, I would take the course, but if you’re looking for an easier distro or an interesting psychology course, I would shy away. I had to spend a good amount of time preparing for the final.",
                    "3": "This course was interesting and the professor was very passionate BUT his slides were impossible to follow and his lectures were so confusing. After going to every lecture, I had to rewatch the lecture just to slightly understand what was going on. Also, I do not understand why the final was 50% of our grade and cumulative when we had time to have multiple other midterms. I think the course could be better organized.",
                    "4": "This was a very interesting coarse that was manageable if you followed along with the material each week. I learned so much about brain disorders and the functions of brain regions as a result.",
                    "5": "TAKE INTRO TO NEUROSCIENCE BEFORE TAKING THIS COURSE!!! I know there are a lot of negative CTECs about this course, but I think the majority of them revolve around the fact that there is a lot of required previously known knowledge to understand what is taught in this course. Professor Paller does teach at a fast pace, and his slides could be better organized, but you can get past those things pretty easily with a previous understanding of basic Nueroscience facts. This course is awesome, though. Super fascinating, and so sick to learn about the neuroanatomy of cognitive deficits. But ya, if you wanna take this course, TAKE INTRO TO NEUROSCIENCE BEFORE TAKING THIS COURSE!!!",
                    "6": "This course is definitely a bit intimidating but manageable. The assignments and quizzes are very fair and the lectures make sense once you go back through them. The final being 50% of the grade is pretty scary though.",
                    "7": "The content is well–organized and interesting, Paller does a pretty good job lecturing. The final is cumulative and there is a lot of information, so it was time–consuming to study for, but the format (answer 14 of 18 or so questions)  made things a little easier. The only thing that was a little unusual about this course was assignments that were due after the cumulative final in the middle of finals week. It just made planning studying a little challenging. Also, there is a 50% grade reduction for an assignment being late at all, which can really hurt your grade given that assignments are worth 40%.",
                    "8": "The weekly quizzes were a great way to study for the final navigate the course material. The beginning of the course was very challenging for me because I didn't have a neuroscience background, but after getting over that hump, the lectures made more sense. I will say that the slides were difficult to follow because they were very dense, but the lectures are recorded so it was helpful to go back and relearn things I didn't understand the first time.",
                    "9": "This class was very very boring I'm not going to lie. The professor just drones on and on and the projects/papers are kind of hit or miss. At first it was nice to have a Psych class that didn't have the usualy Week 3–6–9 midterms, but that just meant the final exam was like 50% of the final grade and we didn't really have anything to prepare for it.",
                    "10": "it was fine. lectuers are recorded. they're not super helpful except some random things are in the final",
                    "11": "This was a great class! Very well organized, making the content flow together and connect rather than jumping all over the place. The instructor was very nice and well prepared, making him a great lecturer – he did not simply repeat what is on the slides but added his own commentary while still sticking to the content on the slides. You will need to keep up with reading and studying for the exam at the end but that is not too bad at all; the assignments and quizzes are not difficult but require a bit of work to do well.",
                    "12": "I had taken this class, thinking it would be mostly psychology, and a break from STEM material as well as a chance to get through some DISTROs in Weinberg. This class is not a class one can sleep through and blow off lectures for. However, it is a very fun class to take. Learning various conditions, the neuroscience behind them, and the story of their discovery, analysis, as well as what we still have yet to learn regarding the brain is fascinating. The coursework is very forgiving, and the tests and exams were great summaries and applications of the material in class. Nothing felt unfair, and the instructor was extremely understanding as well.",
                    "13": "Very interesting material. One final exam worth 50% with the other 50 coming from weekly canvas quizzes and some writing assignments  that were never too hard. All lectures are recorded which was nice too",
                    "14": "It's a fine course. Just pay attention to lectures. It's a little annoying that the final is 50% of the grade. I would rather have 3 midterms than a 50% final so then we know how the grading operates.",
                    "15": "I am a bit biased, because I love the topics covered in the course. I thought the material was incredibly interesting, and fun to learn about. Professer Paller is so nice, and is always able to talk after class and answer any questions. The slide presentations are quite difficult to follow, as they are quite disorganized, however Panopto recordings for every lecture are available to students. Quizzes and Assignments were graded very fairly, and the final exam, although 50 percent of the grade, allowed us to select 4 questions not to answer, with was very helpful. I loved this course, and would certinaly recommend it to anyone who is interested in this topic, but probably not to people looking for an introduction to basic level neuroanatomical ideas, or to anyone who is just looking for a distribution credit.",
                    "16": "This class is very unorganized, you also won't learn much. the final exam is not bad – I learned most of the things from this class by reviewing for this exam",
                    "17": "A great course covering many fascinating aspects of cognitive neuroscience, brain damage, and consciousness.",
                    "18": "Very neuro heavy, but interesting. Good lectures and easy assignments.",
                    "19": "This class was very interesting, the lectures are recorded, and the professor is very very accommodating and is very good at explaining the concepts. However, the slides were a bit hard to read which was a bit inconvenient at times.",
                    "20": "This was an interesting class but it was disorganized at times. Professor Paller is a very nice person and you can tell he is passionate about the subject but he speaks as if you already have background knowledge of neuroscience coming in. There are weekly quizzes and a few written assignments and one final midterm at the end. Near the end I felt as if I was rushing because there was so much material to be learned for the midterm and it seemed impossible to memorize everything. I definitely recommend studying for the course as it occurs and rewatching the lectures. Overall, it was an interesting class but the organization could use some work.",
                    "21": "I think people are a little harsh on this class. It wasn't THAT bad. The content is interesting. Best advice is to keep up with the material, do the readings, put the lecture notes into flashcards and reinforce each week. By doing this you will be prepared. Slides are disorganized and so much content to study for. Super time consuming",
                    "22": "This course involves a lot of reading with short weekly reading quizzes. Other than that, there’s only one final, which is extremely stressful. The professor does not even provide any practice exams, so you go into the final with no idea what the structure of the exam will look like. Also, I took this class with no background in neuroscience, and even though neuroscience technically isn’t a prerequisite, I wouldn’t recommend taking this class without some neuroscience background. It’s a difficult class for people who do know neuroscience, and if you don’t, the neuroscience that you need to know is only covered once, very quickly during a singular lecture.

It develops on the foundations of social, personality, and developmental psychology in a totally coherent way. Definitely not overwhelming like other row 2 classes can be, and it is very manageable. Prof. Chung also is just the absolute best. She really cares about her students and is passionate about teaching the course, which makes understanding the content so much easier to do. The class is 2 article summaries, a child observation paper (which you get to visit a preschool during class to observe the children to write the paper), a film/tv paper, and a final research proposal. If you aren't the biggest research person, I think this is a perfect choice for you because I am not, and I still feel like I got a lot out of it and enjoyed it anyway",

The final research analysis is worth <br><br>so a considerable amount of work and when you turn one paper in there is another one to start working on. i would recommend this class though and she's really accomodating.",

The written assignments were spread out evenly across the quarter, and Professor Chung was always very generous in providing guidance and feedback during her office hours.",

There seemed to be a lot of overlap from personality, social, and developmental psych, but the main difference was the focus on reading and writing research summaries and a final research proposal. I liked being able to research a topic I found personally interesting for my final proposal!"

He grades really nicely and is a great communicator. I personally learned more from reading the case studies which were super interesting",
                    "5": "Good psych class, most of the class was seniors, which was nice as a senior. Gorvine gave a nice overview of psychopathology, gave clear grading, and wasn't too rough. Start the final research proposal weeks in advance, and it can be a breeze."

OMG.  meets weekly at 5pm till 8pm and there are lab activities from 7–8 pm that you often have to stay longer for to finish. <br><br>the test construction project is also a ton of work, and its a GROUP PROJECT and its spaced out which is nice, but like actually so so much work. <br><br>the midterm was SO HARD and there is SO MUCH READING for it. long textbook chapters and other random articles. she gives you review questions to prepare and the test is based on the review questions. but there are like SO MANY REVIEW QUESTIONS that you have to like memorize memorize <br><br>still i really liked renee. if i were you id take psych of beauty or psych of gender instead. not a diss on her. this class just kind of sucked. <br><br>midterm exam (22%), a take–home final exam (22%), a test construction project/paper divided into multiple steps (50%), and several lab exercises (6%).",

This class was a lot of work – You work on a team project to create some measure of a construct for the entirety of the quarter. Signing up for this class alone, I was nervous about making a group. Nonetheless, I found an amazing group, and we had actually a lot of fun working in class together. <br><br>The psychometric theory things sound really intimidating, but Renee makes it SO accessible. The midterm was hard (a true time crunch), but you get to argue back points using the things you learn in the class, which is AMAZING. There’s 2 majors papers and a midterm and a final, but for some reason, it all doesn’t feel overwhelming. In fact, it felt rather stress free!<br><br>Please take this class with Renee. It genuinely changed my thoughts on what I want to learn in grad school, and was a blast. She’s the queen of the psych department, and you won’t be disappointed. I promise!",

Renee Engeln is a great lecturer and explains things very clearly and keeps students super engaged. I definitely would recommend this class. It included a midterm exam, take–home final, and a group project that goes on throughout the whole quarter.",
                    "7": "This course taught me so much about the nitty–gritty details behind the different statistical analyses I read about in journal articles. The midterm and final are very doable, and the group project is fun since you get to choose your own topic and conduct your own research (culminating in your final research paper––running your own analyses and getting results back from your own data is super satisfying!!).",
                    "8": "This is a great class. As with any other Renee class, you do have to do the readings (at least for the in–class midterm exam), but it's not super hard to understand the content and prepare for the exam. She makes it very clear what you need to know from each reading. The midterm isn't super hard if you study straight from her study guides. The class is mostly structured around one giant project where your group makes a novel psych scale. The assignment isn't particularly difficult and actually is quite enjoyable. In terms of learning things for future use, this class is basically if you actually learned things in research methods – very helpful if you want to go to grad school!

If you’re anything like me (respects research but would rather not read papers as a proxy for what could be summarized in lecture slides/notes), you will likely burn out. <br><br><br>In addition to the weekly readings/writeups, each student gives a minimum of 2 presentations on, you guessed it, research papers (!!) throughout the quarter. These were frustratingly time consuming between the length of time it takes to actually read and understand the papers and then summarize them for a 20 minute presentation. The research paper at the end of the course is quite long (minimum 15 sources and 13–15 pages with 1.5 spacing—so basically 8–10 pages single spaced) and frankly was the cherry on top of the burn out cake for me. I don’t think it would have been as bad if the learning format were more varied, but synthesizing a paper of this length after a whole quarter of doing nothing but reading pages upon pages of dense research was beyond mind–numbing.<br><br><br>Overall, even though I really liked the professor, I do not think the class expectations and format are suitable for most undergraduates—the only students who should enroll are those who <br><br>a. are about that PhD life<br><br>b. have an irrepressible zest for language and cognition<br><br>or (ideally..)<br><br>c. are both a and b<br><br><br>If none of these descriptors apply to you, I wouldn't.",

Because she is so familiar with her own work, her grading is so harsh because if you mess anything up, she notices immediately. The class has pop quizzes that are super hard. One time every single person in our class got a question wrong and she shrugged her shoulders and said it should have been easy because it was something we'd covered.",
                    "2": "Very interesting course; you learn a lot from the readings and discussions and Professor Gentner is very passionate and enthusiastic about teaching the subject. That said, THIS IS NOT AN EASY COURSE. The readings take some time and can sometimes be difficult to process. There are also weekly reading commentaries due each week, 2 presentations throughout the quarter, 1 final term paper. The work is difficult but can be enjoyable if you have a strong interest in the subject and in Professor Gentner's work.",

But be sure to actively pay attention and take notes during class because the exams will require you to memorize a lot of information from both the lectures and assigned readings (more heavily weighed toward lecture material). You can lose points quickly that cumulate if you do not remember and the only components that make up your grade include midterm, final, and a group presentation.

Every class was filled with lightheartedness, learning, and coffee chats almost. The class was very straightforward, two exams, one group presentation, couple of readings (that you don't have to read deeply) for each lecture. The exams were hand–written though, which kind of sucked, but they were really straightforward, and the professor never really tried to trick anybody up. The group presentation was of a topic of your choice with a group of his assignment.<br><br>I highly recommend this class to anybody who is looking for an relatively easy and extremely interesting class. I especially recommend it for a row 2 column b for all psych majors out there.",

You have to submit a brief ~1–page paper and discussion post on Canvas before each in–person discussion. At the end of the quarter, you have to write a longer paper on a theoretical memory experiment of your design and give a short 5–min presentation on it during the last 2 class periods, which takes a while but is kinda fun.<br><br>As someone who really, really fears in–class participation and isn't used to this much reading/writing, this class initially seemed really intimidating to me. However, once you start actually doing the work and participating in the discussion, it gets a lot less intimidating –– you spend a couple hours max reading/watching the assigned material, write a few paragraphs on your thoughts, and talk about it in class. It definitely helped that I was really interested in the content and enjoyed learning about human memory and the various experiments we talked about. Also, almost all of the grading is completion–based –– as long as you do all the work and participate in class regularly, you're guaranteed a really good grade.<br><br>In general, I think this is a really good class if you're interested in an upper–level psych class about memory!",

Nonetheless, I found an amazing group, and we had actually a lot of fun working in class together. <br><br>The psychometric theory things sound really intimidating, but Renee makes it SO accessible. The midterm was hard (a true time crunch), but you get to argue back points using the things you learn in the class, which is AMAZING. There’s 2 majors papers and a midterm and a final, but for some reason, it all doesn’t feel overwhelming. In fact, it felt rather stress free!<br><br>Please take this class with Renee.

The midterm and final are very doable, and the group project is fun since you get to choose your own topic and conduct your own research (culminating in your final research paper––running your own analyses and getting results back from your own data is super satisfying!!).",

As with any other Renee class, you do have to do the readings (at least for the in–class midterm exam), but it's not super hard to understand the content and prepare for the exam. She makes it very clear what you need to know from each reading. The midterm isn't super hard if you study straight from her study guides. The class is mostly structured around one giant project where your group makes a novel psych scale. The assignment isn't particularly difficult and actually is quite enjoyable. In terms of learning things for future use, this class is basically if you actually learned things in research methods – very helpful if you want to go to grad school!

In fact, I do want to explore cognitive neuroscience research in my own work, yet I still felt that this course did not meet my expectations. Professor Reber is incredibly intelligent and knowledgeable in the field, and does have a wealth of knowledge to offer. However, I feel that the execution and implementation in the classroom is somewhat subpar. For one, each lecture is always divided into two parts: 1.) Research Implementation      2.) Chapter Review ; in that order. I am still unsure why we wouldn't do the chapter review first, so that we could review our knowledge and make sure we were understanding the material from the textbook correctly, and THEN go on to the research implementation to deepen our understanding and our ability to use and apply well–learned knowledge. Furthermore, I think many of the topics we covered were covered very, very briefly. This is absolutely not Profesor's fault. Rather, it's just the nature of the quarter system. I feel as if this class could be separated into multiple, more in–depth cognitive neuroscience research courses on specific topics in the literature. The final thing that I felt let me down a bit was the lack of depth in the research methodology. I took this class to learn how to use neuroimaging methods to do research. While we did learn a LOT about how to design a good cognitive paradigm for research (which is incredibly important, if not the most important step), I do really wish this course could at least go over some of the basics in how to actually use these methods. I understand that fMRI is very diffiuclt to access, but many of the research staff at NU have EEG setups. I would have absolutely loved to get real, hands–on experience with some sort of neuroimaging procedure, or at the very least learned the basics of how to do them. Don't get me wrong, I do think this class is very helpful in learning how to craft a well–designed neuroimaging experiment, and getting an overview of cognitive localizations in the brain. However, I just feel that a core part of course: Learning neuroimaging, was somewhat limited.",
                    "1": "Generally a good class, lectures can be a bit fast–paced with the prof skipping lots of slides but grading is 1 big test (a \"midterm\" but it's at the 3/4 mark), 1 mini–research proposal (5 pages), 1 big research proposal (your final), and some participation stuff (accumulating 1000 points rather than %) . Prof will say you don't have to do all of the participation stuff but then takes points away so you kinda do – I only missed one and typically got 85–95/100 but I only just got my 1000 points (right before reading week). They're usually not that hard tho.",

There were weekly HW assignments graded only for completion, a midterm, and a final. Both midterm and final were a bit of a time crunch, but they were open–note and not too bad since Prof. gave us a heads up of what to expect beforehand.<br><br>Also, Prof. Rick is the best!!

If you want to do research in psychology, this is a must take.<br><br>Basically, it’s PSYCH 201, but more advanced – This class’ slogan is basically “Hey, remember X from 201? :) Did you *really* understand the logic behind it? How can you *actually* use it?” It’s a crash course on nearly every single major statistics topic you might need to know for analyzing data in psychology (hypothesis testing, regression, t–tests, meta–analyses, ANOVAs, factor analysis, non–parametric methods, etc). You also learn a super easy to use platform called SPSS. <br><br>Professor Rick is one of the best professors I’ve ever had – He did a fantastic job teaching this course. It was a really small class (only 6 of us), but he always made sure everyone was participating and understood things. If you ask for help, he’s super willing. Office hours were a great resource.<br><br>On a normal week, this class was so chill – There are 8 very quick and easy HW assignments, graded for participation. Class was a vibe, and Rick created a zero–stress environment. I wasn’t afraid of getting things wrong or asking questions. <br><br>However, the exams are weighted very very heavily – 30% midterm, 50% final. The final was a ton of pressure for that reason. Both exams were fair (pretty much just what we did in class), but you had to work very quickly to finish everything on time. But, if you take notes, pay attention, and practice a little, you’ll be ok. (Some feedback – Maybe consider lowering the percentage of the class the final is worth to reduce some pressure!)<br><br>The curve is a bit unusual – The top two students in the course set a “reference point” for grading the rest of the class. They get 100%, and every other grade is determined based off of those two students. For example, if the top two students got an average overall grade of a 95%, you need to get an 87.4% or higher to get an A (ie, 92% of the reference point), and so on. Most students did really well for this reason.<br><br>I’m going to miss this class! If you can, take this with Rick :)",

It was a great balance of gaining a conceptual understanding of statistical tests and practicing doing those statistical tests using SPSS.

Professor Zinbarg is an excellent lecturer. He moves through topics in a clear and thoughtful way, and he is always so patient with answering all of our questions! He made complex statistical concepts feel approachable and less intimidating, and he also learned all of the students' names within the first week of classes. I think this is a must–take for anyone who is interested in pursuing research in psychology!",

I learned so so much about SPSS and can see so many practical applications of this class for myself in the future with research.  I had no stats background other than psych stats and this class was still manageable and easy enough to follow along. Professor Zinbarg is great!!"

Material itself is not difficult, although keeping up with all the readings is a bit harder. All 3 exams (no final) were mostly based on lecture, although they always had 3–4 questions from the readings.",
                    "1": "Amazing class. Amazing professor. THE BEST professor I  have had at this school",
                    "2": "This is a very informational course and I like how Professor Finkel used many pop culture and film references while lecturing; he is a very engaging lecturer. However, when it comes down to exam time, it can be a lot to attempt to memorize all the material from lectures and assigned readings. Also, numerous questions can be worded ambiguously and make it more complicated to get the right answer. Fortunately, there are some extra credit opportunities and the exams are curved from the highest grade in the class, but even then it is a bit stressful and challenging trying to do well. With that said, you will need to get ready to take in and consistently actively memorize and study the information as you go. Overall, it is an okay course: very engaging material and lecturer, just kind of a tough evaluation method.",
                    "3": "Eli Finkel has to be one of the best professors at Northwestern. The course was super interesting, and he was such a great lecturer. We laughed a lot and learned a lot. My one very minor critique is that every once in a while, Prof Finkel would mess up the explanation of a study during the lecture. For example, he'd say the conclusion from a study was one thing  when it was actually the opposite. The good thing was that every time this happened (maybe a few times throughout the course), he would just scrap that one little topic from the exam. There's three midterms, the first being the hardest mainly because people underestimate how much stuff you have to remember. So if you want a good grade, actually do the readings and review slides. Office hours with Erin Hughes were very helpful. 60 question multiple choice can trip you up for sure, but don't get discouraged if you do poorly on one of them. I had an 8 point improvement from my first to second midterm after realizing I needed to do more review. Extra credit is also super easy and helps your grade A LOT (one exam percentage point increase per, and there's 4 extra credit assignments).",
                    "4": "Of all the Northwestern courses, this one is a MUST–TAKE. Finkel is the absolute BEST professor in the world and he made his office hours such a fun and engaging environment every time!! The lectures were well–organized and the combination with pop culture references made it all that more engaging. While this is a 300+ person lecture and it's often hard to form a connection with the professor, Finkel was one of the most down–to–earth and easygoing professors I have ever had, and I loved every second I could learn from him. Relationship Science is a relatively unique field and so worth it!!!",
                    "5": "Eli Finkel was borderline misogynistic and problematic a lot of the time. The majority of the crowd was male or so used to the patriarchy that they just laughed along with his heteronormative, white–centered content day–in and day–out. There was one single \"minority\" day, taught by a guest lecturer. As the quarter progressed, he felt more and more at liberty to laugh about very problematic studies, such as the one he conducted in his own lab watching college kids make–out with each other on camera from his office and only telling them that he was recording them after the fact. He was way out of touch with today's norms, yet he desperately attempted to convince us that he was with his irrelevant use of \"gen Z slang\". If you're, for whatever reason, able to sit through this and not feel some type of terrible, uncomfortable way, then I guess take this class if you absolutely have to. Do not take this class if you have any faith in humanity, if you don't want to be depressed every day, or if you care about the advancement of any other demographic besides the white, \"upper–middle class\" (he literally makes thousands of dollars off his students every year by making them buy his book for class), heterosexual male.",
                    "6": "I loved this course. I learned so much and felt like it wasn't that hard regardless.",
                    "7": "Take this class!!! The lectures were awesome and engaging, and I think about the stuff I learned in this class everyday.",
                    "8": "Fun course but tests were hard",
                    "9": "I loved this class! Every lecture was so interesting and the professor was very engaging with the material but using clips from movies/tv shows as examples. I genuinely learned a lot from the course and will definitely apply this in my relationships in the future. The tests aren't bad and basically common sense but make sure to thoroughly take notes on all the readings to do well.",
                    "10": "Definitely do the readings – the exams ask a LOT of questions about them, like about 50% of the exam is not covered in lecture I would say.  But Finkle is great! He's super apraochable but also very knowledgable and a great lecturer. <br><br>ALSO with exams – IMO they tend to be more difficult overall than most other psych classes.",
                    "11": "BEST CLASS AT NU TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT!! just 3 exams (if you do the reading and review, you will be fine but you must do the reading) and some opportunities for extra credit along the way. finkel is incredible and i loved going to each class",
                    "12": "I LOVED this class, it was one of the most engaging classes i’ve taken at Northwestern. To put it into perspective, it filled up tech auditorium and continued to fill it up throughout the entire quarter. I truly enjoyed going to class and I learned things that i could apply to my own life and relationships.",
                    "13": "The best thing about this class is the content. I may be biased because I love love and I love science, and these two passions get to come together in this fantastic class. Anyone could get some valuable info out of it, I definitely plan to keep the things I learned in mind when approaching my relationships. A is very achievable, make sure you READ though. Lot of info can be gained from the texts, sometimes even info not mentioned in lecture (that shows up on the exams)!!",
                    "14": "I love the professor. He is very engaging and really helps us understand the material through outside films and videos. Felt like I got a better understanding of how relationships work through psychological studies and real life scenarios. It definitely is not an easy class since there are 3 exams that test your knowledge of lecture content and outside readings. Take the class if you're interested and okay with a more difficult class.",
                    "15": "Excellent distro! Not overly difficult, lectures are fun, Prof. Finkel is awesome! I super recommend!",
                    "16": "Highly recommend taking this course. The content is very interesting, and Prof. Finkle is great at engaging the class. For exams, make sure you study the readings and the experiments mentioned in lecture.",
                    "17": "I really enjoyed this course and Professor Finkel is engaging and passionate, but there was still not enough focus on queer and nonwhite relationships although he acknowledged the lack of research on it in the field. There is one class of a \"diversity\" lecture with info that I would just suggest incorporating into relevant lectures.  Exams are tricky and you need to do the readings.",
                    "18": "THE BEST CLASS I HAVE TAKEN AT NORTHWESTERN! TAKE THIS CLASS! Eli Finkle is hilarious. The lectures are sooo engaging; I wanted to go to class. There is outside reading that NEEDS to be done in order to be successful on the exams, but if you prioritize your time well it should be alright. I highly recommend this class though. Take it if you have the space in your schedule!",
                    "19": "Best professor ever. Course material and tests were hard, but it was a fun class!",
                    "20": "Favorite class of the quarter. Found the topics very engaging and Eli was a great instructor who incorporates a lot of film/TV show clips to represent certain topics. Takes a lot of work to get an A though – the assigned readings add up and will definitely appear on the exams even if the material was not touched in class. As long as you do them, the exams are manageable.",
                    "21": "This is hands–down the best course I have taken at Northwestern! Professor Finkel has so much enthusiasm for relationship science and his lectures were always something to look forward to. I especially enjoyed the many movie clips used to present lecture content. However,  I must admit that there is quite a bit of reading in this class, which is required to do well on the midterms. The 3 midterms were graded fairly, but they could be a little tricky at times. There are 3 extra credit opportunities, though, which are very helpful.",
                    "22": "Loved this course! Eli was great and the class was a ton of fun. You learn a lot about the nature of romantic relationships. A TON of reading is assigned but it's generally pretty interesting. I think the exams were graded fairly, but some of my peers said they didn't do as well on the exams.",
                    "23": "I loved this class!! It's a super engaging course with an amazingly funny professor about topics that are genuinely interesting. I think it was wonderfully well done. You didn't even notice the time going by so quickly because the class moves at a quick yet engaging pace that always makes sure you're paying attention and listening. If you can, you really really should take this class.",
                    "24": "Great class! My only issue was that the exams were a bit of a mess when it came to clarity of questions. It felt as though the test questions didn't allow for nuance the way that class discussions and the readings did. It was really frustrating to have to ask so many questions about what the questions were saying (not j me, the TAs were running around trying to get to everyone during the exam). <br><br>Nevertheless this class was really great and a lot of fun! Finkel is a great lecturer and he would often show videos in class to demonstrate concepts which was super helpful for remembering things long term. The class also provides an opportunity for anyone to learn in a way that can improve their relationships, even though much of the research is on straight white people (im lesbian and latine but still got a lot from it). I highly recommend this class, just be prepared to do some reading.",
                    "25": "Great class. Easy A. I recommend you show up to lecture, they are very engaging and fun anyways (except for like 1–2 about that were on boring topics). Can get away with not doing textbook readings but do the other ones. Love the professor!!",
                    "26": "This class is the absolute coolest. Favorite class at nu – the lectures are so interesting, finkel is the besttt professor, the exams are fair, and the readings outside of class aren't overwhelming. Other than the 3 exams, it's just readings but nothing else is graded.",
                    "27": "This was a great class. Professor Finkel is incredibly well versed in the material and makes lecture interesting and entertaining. The exams can be a little challenging, and if you want an A you definitely have to do the readings.  The class itself has a lot of great information infused within it and its definitely useful for understanding current and future relationships.",
                    "28": "Loved this class! It's huge –&nbsp;100s of people, so don't expect a personalized experience in any way. You can get away with not doing any work most weeks, but you do have to cram during the exam weeks (3 over quarter, make up your whole course grade). The exams are fine if you study well, but they do require you to do the readings outside of class and apply your knowledge to hypothetical situations. Professor Finkel is an extremely engaging lecturer and very respected in the field of relationship science. You won't have a problem paying attention in lecture – we watch tons of clips from rom–coms to dissect relationship phenomena! Definitely don't take this class if you're uncomfortable talking about the science of sex LOL",
                    "29": "This class was really interesting and funny. I felt like excited to go to class every week. The readings were necessary to do well on exams but it’s not too hard to get through them.",
                    "30": "I liked this class and would recommend it if you are a psych major/minor since its a chill 300 level class! Prof. Finkel's lectures were great. Three exams that make up your entire grade (plus like a few extra credit points) which is a bit frustrating because the exams aren't exactly the easiest but they are manageable.  My only concern was when questions were worded a bit confusingly.",
                    "31": "I enjoyed this class, however I do wish that there were more opportunities for evaluation for this course, especially given how much content is taught for this class. Having 3 exams be the only form of evaluation was difficult, especially because the tests are all multiple choice, so there isn't room for partial credit in the exams. I thought the lectures were very engaging, surprisingly so for such a huge lecture. Professor Finkel's lectures were very interesting to listen to because he always provides relevant movies/shows to demonstrate some of the relationship dynamics he teaches about. Overall, I am happy I took this class, and I learned a lot, I just wish there were more ways to be graded (quizzes, more than 3 tests, etc.)",
                    "32": "Really awesome class. Not much work outside of exams however, only grades are 3 exams. Exams  require a decent amount of studying and aren't easy.",
                    "33": "Professor Finkel is one of the best lecturers at NU and covers a lot of ground very well. The exams are challenging and you need to do the readings for them, which is a decent amount for a psych class",
                    "34": "This is a great class. The professor is a great lecturer and all the content is applicable to your own life.",
                    "35": "Fun professor, every class was a blast. Professor has humor and I appreciate the content he prepared.",
                    "36": "very interesting, definitely some readings to do. lectures are fun and educational",
                    "37": "I wanted to take this class to learn because I was really interested in the topic even though I knew it is known for having a lot of material and hard exams. I went to class everyday and sat in the front. I did not look at any of the readings. I scored exactly average on every exam (idk about the final but that was rough because of other reasons). Every exam has around 6ish questions from the readings. If you dont do the readings, you probably wont get an A in the class. A B though if you can memorize whats on the slides, is very doable.",
                    "38": "This is a super unique and interesting class. I will say, as someone who was taking it for fun, it is a little harder than I would hope, but still a great class.",
                    "39": "Finkel's a terrific professor. Wish it wasn't all exams and wish this class was smaller to discuss concepts, because they were really interesting",
                    "40": "I really enjoyed this course! The content was easy to understand, and the lectures were informative and also entertaining. I enjoyed the use of videos to explain things that happen in relationships, and the way the slides were organized made it easy to make flashcards for the exams. The exam questions were, for the most part, fair, but I recommend going back to the readings, especially in the marriage book and the textbook, and making flashcards for that on top of the stuff from class. I found that flashcards were the best way to study for these exams.",
                    "41": "not an easy class by any means. exams were challenging and there was an immense amount of material for each. Finkel incredibly engaging, but lots of the readings were redundant and questions would be poorly written/nitpicky.",
                    "42": "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! This was truly one of the best classes that I have ever taken at Northwestern, and I could not encourage you more to take it. The professor was so funny and such a great lecturer, and I always looked forward to going to class. While there was a lot of reading (on average, one chapter from the textbook and one chapter from his marriage book per day), they were super interesting as well and easy to read, except for some of the journal articles. There were no assignments other than three non–cumulative exams, and they were honestly pretty easy/doable, especially if you have taken psych exams before. They also offered 3–4 points total of extra credit for a simple reflection assignment before each exam and curved the tests, so it wasn't hard to do well.<br><br>Even though I have taken like 8 psychology classes before, this was probably the one that was the most relevant to everyday life. We talked about attraction, attachment, aggression, how to improve relationships, and more. I learned so much from this course, and I'm sure I'll be looking back at my notes in the future to try to make my relationships better haha. Again, please take this class if you can; you won't regret it!",
                    "43": "This class was super fun! The midterms were hard though",
                    "44": "THIS CLASS IS AMAZING.This is the best class I have taken at northwestern so far.The content is very applicable in real–life and the professor is amazing.I never skipped class at all because class is so much fun! However, there is a lot of readings for each class. The test is 60 multiple choice questions and can be a little hard if you don't study, but doable with  revision.Overall an easy A– , but harder to get an A.",
                    "45": "This is the best class I've ever taken, Northwestern or otherwise. The content in this course is the most interesting and applicable material you will learn in a class. I learned more about myself and my relationships with other people, romantic and platonic. Some studies that we looked at in class or in the readings blew my mind with their accuracy and novelty. The only downside to this course is the amount of reading outside of class to be done, but at least there was no other homework besides the reading, and they were very interesting most of the time. The class depends entirely on 3 midterms, which can be stressful because messing up on one of them can decide your entire grade. Eli Finkel is the funniest and best lecturer I've had. Even if you don't need this class for a distro, I would still take it for the experience.",
                    "46": "This course was super fun and engaging. Professor Finkel is a great lecturer and all of the content was super interesting and relevant to life. Tests were not too bad if you study, so definitely make sure to study. Readings could get a little long, but all manageable if you make the time for them or split them up. Overall, great course, would highly recommend!",
                    "47": "This course is a great elective to take. It isn't difficult at all. 3 exams worth 1/3 of your grade each and they are not cumulative. Exams are multiple choice as well. I found it was pretty easy to just pay attention in lecture to do very well on the exams. If you do all the readings it is nearly impossible to get less than a 90 on the exams. Lectures are really great and interesting, but honestly the content isn't very surprising. Every concept is pretty expected and straightforward. For example, you will learn that creative people are more passionate in their relationships. It's interesting, but did you expect anything else? Take this course to have fun and experience great lectures and teaching. It is a pretty easy A as well if you do the minimum readings",
                    "48": "There is a reason why this class is so popular, Professor Finkel is amazing. He is very funny charismatic and passionate about the course and the exams (which are 100% of the grade) are really not that bad so long as you study and utilize the widely available quizlets online.",
                    "49": "I learned SO MUCH about relationships! The clips of pop culture, films, media, etc really helped exemplify the concepts and helped me understand. Relationship attachment styles, stressors, intimacy enhancement, aptitude vs compatibility, communication, conflict and resolution, different phases of a relationship, growth vs destiny mindsets, etc. It was a lot of information to memorize, especially since class lectures, Prof Eli Finkel’s marriage book, textbook, and other supplemental readings were fair game on exams, which made them pretty difficult and it’s unfortunate that the class was only 3 unit exams and some extra credit, so not an easy A–/A… but truly a fun and valuable class! Also I really appreciated the inclusion of some LGBTQIA+ diversity data and insight from Emma’s guest lecture. It is probably not acknowledged enough that much of the (relationship) psych data has overrepresentation of WEIRD (white, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic) and white hetero american women. Would be more interesting to be more inclusive of non–hetero relationships.",
                    "50": "I loved this course!! Probably my favorite class I’ve taken at Northwestern. The material is so interesting and applicable to your own life and Professor Finkel is awesome.",
                    "51": "Highly recommend this class! Professor Finkel is an interesting and charismatic lecturer. If you are interested in romance or rom–coms at all, you will enjoy this course. If you do the readings and know the content for the lectures exams are not too bad. Also, a good class to take with a friend!",
                    "52": "This class is amazing. Finkel does an amazing job of engaging with the entire lecture hall and using modern examples to explain confusing concepts. The exams are much more confusing than the TA's make it out to be and a lot of the times you get stuck on questions. To succeed in this class you need to pay attention in class and do all the readings.",
                    "53": "Good distro class, the lectures are interesting and prof. Finkel is super funny and engaging. Class grade consists of 3 exams and an extra credit opportunity. The class has a surprising amount of reading, but you can get by just skimming.",
                    "54": "This class was great! The grade is entirely based on 3 multiple choice exams which is nice because there was very little work for the class besides attending lecture and looking over readings before exams. I would not say this class is an easy A though. The content is fascinating, Finkel is very accomplished and an amazing, entertaining lecturer. Learned a lot that applies to real life.",
                    "55": "TAKE. THIS. CLASS. Finkel is the unequivocal goat. Lectures are super interesting, using a combination of explanations, study results, and movie clips showing how the concepts we learn work out in \"the real world.\"  There are quite a few readings, and tests aren't something you can just show up to and do well on – you really have to do the readings, even just going to lectures isn't enough. But you can get by skipping a few or cramming :) Most of the readings are enjoyable though, and if you're at all interested in the psychology of relationships, you will love this class.",
                    "56": "It's a decent class, the material itself is not difficult but the exam questions can sometimes be a bit unnecessarily detailed. The class has 3 midterms, all MCQ and there are extra credit questions.",
                    "57": "It was very fun and interesting.",
                    "58": "If you're looking for an easy distro this is a great option: engaging lectures, slides are posted, and the only graded component is 3 multiple choice exams (not cumulative, and no final during finals week); however, the professor can be a bit crass, so if that gets on your nerves I would highly consider going a different route. If you are a psych major/minor looking for a good psych class, would not recommend. Way too many of the course readings are the professor's own research (you have to buy/read the book he wrote + articles) so you don't get really any other perspectives from the field. Additionally, all the research presented comes from samples that are predominately white college students and then these samples are used to make generalize about the entire world; the professor also really doesn't admit to the limitations of the research. If you're interested in this topic and want to encounter solid research I would take Social Psychology over this; it covers this info and more and has much more nuanced perspectives.",
                    "59": "Professor is a funny dude and I highly recommend this as a distro. Not because its an obvious easy A but the material is so easy to relate to and reflect on so it makes the learning process wayyyy more accessible IMO. Also if you're in a relationship situationship whatever its like personal therapy every lecture and is great for your own personal development as a human in some ways! That being said you actually have to do all the readings  at least skimming and go to class but not bad . ALl of the material is relatively common sense.",
                    "60": "I really enjoyed this class. Professor Finkel makes class engaging and made me more interested in the material.",
                    "61": "This class was shockingly patriarchal, heteronormative, and Eurocentric. Every piece of content that didn't have to do with straight white couples was pushed into a single lecture titled \"diversity.\" This was a complete shame for a Northwestern class––the psychology department needs to do better.<br><br>3 exams (33% x3). This class isn't hard, but you absolutely cannot get an A without doing readings. Only about half of the test content is covered in lecture, which is really stupid given that about half of lecture time was spent goofing around. But there's some interesting stuff and Eli's nice.",
                    "62": "AMAZING course. Prof Finkel is a great lecturer and keeps you engaged for the entire 80 minutes. If you have any interest in the class, take it. Only work is 3 midterm exams which are not easy but as long as you do the readings and study you should be fine. We also had an incredibly easy extra credit opportunity that allowed for us to get up to 4 whole percentage points added to our final grade (not sure if this particular extra credit will stay the same since it was for a study the prof was conducting).",
                    "63": "I enjoyed this class a lot more than I expected! Going in not really being too interested in psychology, this course opened my eyes to the interesting work and applications being done not only in this field, but in a lot of psychology as well. Lectures really were very engaging yet also informative –&nbsp;the examples and videos shown to exemplify the concepts were all chosen quite well, and not only made lecture fun but also informative. I think that the readings also did a good job of complementing the lecture content –&nbsp;sometimes it felt a little bit redundant, but that was not a huge factor. Exams were also very fair in my opinion. I really liked this class! &lt;3",
                    "64": "This class is so illuminating! Genuinely changed my life lol, really interesting and Professor Finkel is super funny and a great lecturer! Take this class!!",
                    "65": "Take this class! The content is so interesting and prof fink definitely tries to make it relevant to college students. I genuinely learned so much and enjoyed going to class. Only 3 multiple choice midterms but they are kind of challenging. You do actually have to do the readings and listen in class if you want to do well",
                    "66": "I really liked this class!! It's so interesting and will make you see relationships in a different light. Professor Finkel is also an amazing lecturer who definitely knows his stuff. The readings are really long and annoying to do, but you need to do them for the exams. I found the exams pretty challenging though. But regardless, TAKE THIS CLASS.",
                    "67": "This course is a fun one and I would recommend it, but it was super frustrating that all relationship science experiments and studies were on white straight people. As a queer person at Northwestern I expected better, and I didn't learn much at all that applied to me personally which was very frustrating.",
                    "68": "GREAT CLASS! Definitely take it if you have a chance. You'll learn so much interesting stuff that's actually applicable to everyday life. Probably one of the most influential classes I've taken at NU. The exams are hard to do well on, though, and you definitely need to study a lot for them. Prof Finkel is absolutely awesome.",
                    "69": "This was a very interesting course and the information was fun to learn! The exams are a bit tricky and would be impossible to do well on without keeping up with the readings and lecture. This is a large lecture and Prof. Finkel does not make himself super available to the students (office hours for two hours and not open to email) so if you need any assistance you work closely with the TAs.",
                    "70": "Best class I’ve taken at NU. Content is relevant and interesting, only 3 exams that are very fair with averages of 87.",
                    "71": "My ONLY but HUUUUGE issue with this class is that it's SO CLEARLY made–by–a–straight–white–man and made–for–other–straight–white–men. Queer relationships were a total afterthought, and it seemed funny to me that there were more same sex couples described in hypothetical test questions than actually talked about in–class (again, serving afterthought).  I also think that this class could've benefited a lot more from a feminist perspective, as certain comments rubbed me the wrong way (e.g. saying Incels are \"a little misogynistic\" was a bit of a slap in the face to any woman who's ever had the displeasure of meeting one lmao), and we never really got into the power dynamics of straight relationships much. <br><br>Certain ideas in this class generally struck me as the recipe for making a good relationship ~for him~ rather than considering the ways in which heterosexual relationships may still be unequal thanks to implicit misogyny – for instance, I wholeheartedly reject the idea promoted in this class that \"spouses should be willing to have sex for the benefit of the other partner even when they may not want to\" ––  it's basically shorthand for \"**women** should be willing to have sex for the benefit of **men** even when they may not want to\" (particularly given how much this class emphasizes how important sex is for men compared to women, like are we not supposed to put 2 and 2 together here...?). It's frankly disturbing to see this prescriptive idea perpetuated by an authority figure when just about every women I know has been coerced into having sex by a male partner within the context of an intimate, romantic relationship on at least one occasion.  I personally still had a good time taking this course, and it was very low–stress and manageable. Just really wish the straight white guy at the front of the room drew from intersectional ideas and perspectives, because women and queer people are NOT the key demographic of this course.",
                    "72": "The professor is funny so the lectures aren't boring, but the class material is really redundant and I didn't really learn anything about relationships. You pretty much just learn a bunch of statistics/parameters about the US population.  I would recommend if you want an easy, fun class, but would not recommend if you actually want to learn about psychology.",
                    "73": "This course is incredibly interesting. Professor Finkel is engaging and every class flies by. The material is easy to connect with and the book is also fun to read for class. The tests aren't too bad, although you do need to read for them.",
                    "74": "GREAT professor, so funny and charismatic. Sometime got lost when explaining more specific aspects of his research rather than the thoeries themselves",
                    "75": "awesome class. surprisingly longish readings. recommend taking it pass fail but still doing the readings to get more out of it. also take it with friends, makes it so much more fun! professor finkel just gives such fun lectures it was so enjoyable to go to class ––– definitely a bucket list class!!!!!!",
                    "76": "This class was honestly the most entertaining topic and Professor Finkel is a great lecturer. I really enjoyed going to class. I would recommend checking canvas before the first day of class and to read all the readings even if they seem unimportant. DO THE EXTRA CREDIT and study for the exams, it is not common sense.",
                    "77": "This class is a MUST TAKE. The material we learned was super interesting, and it will definitely stick with me in the future. We did have a lot of readings to do before class (textbook readings, readings from the professor's own book, and occasionally readings on Canvas), but the grading came down to three exams. I wish there were more opportunities for extra credit to bump our grades up though. Overall, the class material is super interesting and will definitely make you psychoanalyze your relationships.",
                    "78": "I am a firm believer that this class is not as good as people say it is. You have to read the textbook (including Finkel's own book) to do well on exams which is frustrating because a fair portion of lecture is spent watching videos instead of going over material, which is engaging but would make more sense to me to have the optional activity (video watching) happen outside of class and the required activity (learning) happening in class. Most of the results presented are not very convincing, but the second eli finkel sees a p value less than 0.05 he seems to accept that as the word of god. Y axes are also regularly scaled to make effect sizes look larger than they actually are, and data presented in lecture is rarely cited so students are unable to draw their own conclusions about what study results mean–– we instead have to memorize the conclusions that the study conductors came to, and regurgitate those answers on exams. Relationships were definitely a big part of this class. Science, less so.",
                    "79": "I really like this class! It's very chill, only 3 exams for the whole quarter.  The exams are multiple choice and not bad but not easy. The prof makes the content very fun and enjoyable, and he puts video and movie clips to make the content more relatable.  There is a lot of reading for this class though, and I would say the reading is important for the exams. However, you learn a lot from this class that you can use in your life.",
                    "80": "This class is an easy distro, a great major/minor req, or even just a fun class to take in general. Prof. Finkel is a great lecturer, both entertaining and informative. The class only has 3 non–cumulative exams and ends before reading week, so the workload is not bad either – take it if you can.",
                    "81": "This is an amazing class that everyone should take. Professor Finkel is one of the greatest lecturers I've had at NU –– he's so interesting, funny, and gives the information in the best way. The only downside to the class is the reading –– there's a TON, and you need to do it for the tests (which are pretty hard). It's a class that's absolutely worth taking, but the readings do take more time than you want them to.",
                    "82": "This class was not as as hard as the people last year said it would be. Just make sure to read the readings and pay attention in class, and you will be fine. Prof Finkel is really great: a movie and TV show connoisseur, funny and engaging with his use of video clips in lecture slides.. All in all, definitely recommend this class",
                    "83": "It was a pretty fun class BUT kinda overrated if you are looking for a lot of scientific psych explanation. I feel like I had fun listening to interesting theories but really had a hard time compelled by them….",
                    "84": "Interesting topics, enjoyed going to class. Keep up on material it goes fast and exams test you on a lot",
                    "85": "Took this class for fun and it met my expectations. Super interesting content and lectures, made me excited to attend lecture. Make sure to do the readings for the exams, which are relatively straightforward. 3 exams, class ends before finals week.",
                    "86": "A fun class, the professor is great.",
                    "87": "Very interesting course content, but if you want to do well be prepared to read and study a LOT. Entire grade consists of 3 exams, nothing else. Exams are definitely challenging.",
                    "88": "The course is a lot of reading, but if you keep up roughly within the five class segments (three midterms, each after five classes noncumulative), then it isn't too hard to prepare for the midterms. You can learn a lot and Prof. Finkel makes the lectures entertaining.",
                    "89": "Professor Finkel is the best part of this class without a doubt. Such a charismatic guy, at first what seems like a long lecture is made short with him. The cntent is interesting as well, great learning about all the studies especially those conducted on campus.",
                    "90": "This class was so much fun! While the material and research did skew very heavily toward cishet couples (why that is the case was talked about in class), I thought the lecture content was very interesting and felt relevant to how I view all of my close relationships, not just romantic ones. Eli makes lectures engaging and relatable, frequently using movies and reality TV clips to demonstrate a concept he just talked about. This is probably one of the best psych courses I have taken at Northwestern and the barrier to entry to get something useful out of the class is so low that I often invited my friends to come to lectures and they would have a great time. There are three exams, all multiple–choice. It is pretty doable, just make sure to do all the assigned readings as there may be a sizable amount of questions dedicated to them that are not covered through lectures. Aside from that, I had very little work outside of class. Overall, this is a great class to fulfill a requirement or just take for fun!",
                    "91": "Definitely a very interesting class, but requires work.  there's a good amount of readings every class and you need to do them and know them for the exam. Great class overall though. Interesting topic and the professor is very engaging",
                    "92": "This was one of the best courses I have taken at Northwestern. The concepts are extremely interesting ranging from attraction to love to conflict to improving relationships. This professor is an amazing lecturer, he is super engaging, using clips from various movies/shows to illustrate concepts, is funny and communicates very clearly. I have never seen a class of 400 people so engaged in a course before. The lectures are the best part but the exams, not so much. There are 3 non–cumulative midterms and no final, each midterm covering a different section of the course. The midterms are very challenging, they consist of questions from both the lectures and specifics from the readings so you actually have to thoroughly read. However, I think it is worth taking regardless because it is a great class overall, and it is nice to end early without any final.",
                    "93": "This is an amazing class!!! I will say, I would not call this an easy A. The class is composed of just two midterms and a final, each of which makes up 1/3 of your grade, which can make it hard to do well if you do poorly on even just one of the tests. However, in my opinion, the grading situation is completely worth it for the quality of the class. Professor Finkel is incredible, and I have never seen Tech Auditorium so full. There never seemed to be a drop off in attendance because people were actually so invested in it. He is so funny and incorporates TV shows like Love Island and Friends into the lessons to demonstrate the material. I literally felt like I was watching stand up comedy sometimes. I genuinely learned so much in this course and I was sad when it ended. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!",
                    "94": "The best class I've ever taken at NU. HE's such a good lecturer and so engaging. all the concepts apply to everyday life and its so digestible to learn. however I did not great on the tests so definitely do closer readings",
                    "95": "Possibly the most interesting class I have ever taken. Readings are long but there is no other homework so it balances out. You need to do the readings in order to do well in the course. Also make sure you do the extra credit. TAKE THIS CLASS!",
                    "96": "Not an incredibly easy A if you're taking as a distro, the exams can be pretty hard and require you to know a lot from the readings and the lectures (readings can cover content not in the lectures that will be on the exams). Very reading heavy course, you're expected to read a few chapters from the textbook and the professor's own book or some other material before each class, and if you don't you basically have to cram them in some time before the exam because all the material is free to be on the exam. I'd say the actual content is pretty common sense, kind of just putting a name onto things you might already know, but some things are pretty specific so the exams can be tricky.",
                    "97": "The course consists of 3 exams, with an extra credit opportunity before each exam. Prof. Finkel is the best professor I've had during my 3 years at Northwestern, and I've already had a number of amazing professors in the psych department. Prof. Finkel is genuinely so passionate about the topic, and he uses his own experiences and book to illustrate many of the points he is teaching about. His lectures are extremely well–organized, well–timed, and well–presented, and he also answers many questions during class. You do definitely still have to do a decent amount of reading of the textbook and Prof. Finkel's marriage book, but as long as you put in some work, take notes, and study for a bit, it's not hard to get a good grade (especially with the extra credit!). This was probably my favorite class I've taken at this school, and I definitely recommend you take this class if you're interested in learning about relationship science, regardless of what your school/major is.",
                    "98": "Topics were all very interesting and came together at the end of the course",
                    "99": "This class is extremely fun, but be warned: tests are extremely confusing, to the point where questions have to be removed in real time because they're impossible to interpret. If you're not hung up on grades and you're willing to accept a C+ to B+ range in exchange for a highly entertaining class with some great life advice, I'd highly recommend. Not great for the GPA but incredible for life skills!",
                    "100": "I cannot emphasize how much I enjoyed this course. Definitely take this. Professor Finkel is so engaging and lively, and the content was so interesting. I looked forward to class every week. No homework for this class other than the weekly readings, which you must do to keep up and do well on exams. Exams are difficult to get an A on, but if you go to lectures and do the readings, you will do well.",
                    "101": "I cannot recommend this course enough. If you have the opportunity to take this class, you MUST.  First, the structure of this class is great. No homework except for weekly readings (which are not crazy long and are also very interesting), and three, equally weighted midterms– no crazy final. While it is a lot of memorization, the course content is SO interesting. Have you dated someone? Do you want to date someone? Did you just break up with someone? Do you know people who are dating? If your answer was yes to any of these questions, you will love this class. This is the one lecture–based class at Northwestern where I actually showed up to every single class and paid attention to every single slide– that's how great it is. Also– Professor Finkel? Amazing. The most interesting and engaging lecturer I've ever had. The way he teaches and bridges theories and studies to modern–day pop–culture examples makes it difficult to not listen. I've told everyone I know and now I'm telling you: take this class. You will not regret it.",
                    "102": "I LOVED THIS CLASS!!!! It was so entertaining, the lectures felt like TED talks. I loved that there were tv show/movie clips tied into the lecture. This class felt very applicable and relevant to my life. I actually declared a psych minor after taking this class. We were only graded on three exams but I felt like the grading was very fair and straight forward. There was even an opportunity for extra credit. TAKE THIS CLASS!!",
                    "103": "Incredibly interesting, super fun, everyone at NU should take it. Exams were kinda hard tho",
                    "104": "Very interesting class. Readings were sometimes a lot to be honest, but still manageable. You have your first exam the third week. Definitely need to review literally everything given/assigned to you to do well on exam.",
                    "105": "This class was a lot of fun and I would definitely recommend it to anyone with any interest in psychology. Prof. Finkel makes it a very engaging class with pop culture references/video clips, and he's also pretty funny and regularly interacts with students. The only assignments for the class are 3 midterms with EC opportunities, and the nice thing is that there's no final, so class ended a lot earlier than most do. There is a lot of reading for the class, but it was interesting to read and if you stay on top of it, it's not too bad.",
                    "106": "Take this class. It's so fun and Finkel is a great lecturer. It's a decent amount of reading but very interesting content.",
                    "107": "Yes, I enjoyed the readings and the lectures. Analyzing the video clips in class was fun, as they helped illustrate the relationship concepts we'd been discussing. This course also helped to clarify why I sometimes felt friction in my own relationship, and has helped me understand how to better improve my relationships. <br>Professor Finkel is an extremely engaging lecturer and communicates his ideas and research clearly.  Sometimes I wish class speed was even faster, as we could fit more content there.",
                    "108": "Finkel is a great lecturer; it feels like watching a TedTalk every class. Super funny and engaging. I learned a lot in the class that was applicable in my life. However, I did not think the exams were well written. The \"correct\" for a lot of questions I missed could not even be explained by the TAs who wrote their questions; a lot of wording was very unclear and I do not think the exams reflect how much I studied the content.",
                    "109": "I enjoyed this course and found the material interesting. I ended up taking is P/N since it didn't count towards my requirements, and since it wasn't as easy to get an A as my friends and I thought it would be. Your entire grade is made up of just 3 exams (multiple choice), the medians for which we're usually about 85–90% even after curves and extra credit, so I wouldn't go in again expecting to get an A without a lot of extra studying.",
                    "110": "I was very pleased with this course because it taught me a lot about my personal love life, as well as relationships in general.",
                    "111": "This is a super interesting class but the amount of reading is kind of crazy for what the class is. No homework, just 3 exams.",
                    "112": "I LOVED this course!!! The lectures are so entertaining, and the professor does an excellent job teaching content and incorporating engaging video materials from shows, movies, etc. I genuinely enjoyed going to class! Warning – the readings are a lot, and you have to do them to do well on the exams. I spent ~8 hours a week taking notes on the various readings, but honestly I did not really mind it because they were so interesting. For the exams, you have to study hard and make sure you have a thorough understanding of all readings and class notes. It is definitely a time consuming process. The exams are 60 MC questions, and although I felt like I had a great understanding of the content, I still sometimes struggled on the questions because some were very specific. There are 3 easy extra credit opportunities that, if you do all of them, can add 4 percentage points to your grade, which was a nice cushion.",
                    "113": "Great class, amazing lectures. Lots of reading––and they do test you on the readings––so make sure to do them each week and honestly, just start a study guide reviewing the class content as you go through the quarter. It makes studying a lot easier since there's so much content to make your study guide as you go through each lecture––otherwise you'll crash and burn. Professor Finkel is an amazing lecturer though, cannot stress that enough, and the class topics are super interesting and applicable to life",
                    "114": "This is such an interesting class to take! Amazing lecturer and amazing slides, but there are a lot of readings that you have to do. If you do them, then an A is definitely possible.",
                    "115": "The course material is easy, the test are just made to REALLY make sure you understand and lowkey try to trip you up sometimes.  I'm REALLY hoping this next test gets curved....",
                    "116": "i loved this course and would absolutely recommend it. the slides were easy to follow and the only grades are the 3 exams which are not super difficult as long as you study,",
                    "117": "Take this class!! This is one of the most interesting and fun classes I have ever taken at Northwestern. Not only is the content incredibly engaging in and of itself, but Finkel is an amazing professor who never fails to make the class laugh at all points throughout lecture. This is one of those classes where you are never bored and that passes by quickly and without dragging. You find yourself looking at the content and applying it to your own life as well. There's only three exams and while they are a bit challenging, it is definitely possible to get an A in the class. If you take this class for nothing else, take it for the amount of times you'll crack up while hearing Finkel teach. It is totally worth it, and everyone, no matter your major, should take it.",
                    "118": "AMAZINGGGGG please take this class! Professor Finkel is an amazing lecturer and as of now, this is the only undergrad course he teaches. Take advantage of office hours and pay attention in class. He is an amazing speaker and truly makes this class special. I learned a lot of great things about relationships and communication. This was my 5th class of the quarter and was not too much extra effort– definitely worth it.",
                    "119": "Such a great class. Eli is such an engaging lecturer and his use of movie/TV clips really helps to understand the concepts. Make sure to do the readings as the exams are not particularly easy. As long as you study and take it seriously, you will be fine.  I truly feel like I learned so much from the class.",
                    "120": "TAKE THIS COURSE!! Definitely not an easy A but course changed my life.  It’s literally like relationship therapy every week. Feels like every class is a TED talk. Never been excited to go  class but I genuinely looked forward to attending class.",
                    "121": "I am now my friends' relationship advisor. It remains to be seen whether the lessons I've learned will help me in my own relationships.",
                    "122": "TAKE THIS CLASS!! This class is such a favorite of mine, I'm genuinely sad that it's over. Prof Davis and all of the TAs are amazing, the readings were pretty interesting (though there is a lot of it), and the lectures were so entertaining. You can tell Prof Davis is into what he's teaching, and his lectures are so funny and engaging. He relates concepts to familiar shows/movies, to our lives, and to his own, so I found all of the concepts to be not only easy to grasp but fun to learn. It's also not hard to do well in this class. Grades are based off of 3 multiple choice exams, with extra credit opportunities for each of them. You kinda need to do some of the reading to do really well on them, but if you understand the lectures you can also just get by with a quick review and common sense. And testing out the theories on your own relationships is a pretty good way to prepare too lol. But seriously take this class. I loved it, and I'm so glad I took it (my bf is too).",
                    "123": "This class was amazing! I loved every part of it. You learn so much, but the class never feels dull. The workload is light, so it felt better learning without the pressure of having to understand every single part of every lecture.",
                    "124": "The professor was just fantastic, very enthusiastic and stimulating. He truly made the class fun and the 80mins bearable. Def take the class. Easy A or A– and there are a lot of extra credit opp.",
                    "125": "I loved this class! Finkel was one of the best professors I've had at Northwestern, and he was super interesting to listen to. He was super engaging and every lecture was so fun to listen to. There was a lot of reading, but it was always interesting and pretty easy to comprehend. The class itself was really great, but the tests were unnecessarily complicated. They are written by the TAs and in my opinion, very poorly written.",
                    "126": "eli is a cool professor, loved this course came to class excited to learn, idea’s communicated quite well, humorous and cool class",
                    "127": "very engaging lecture!",
                    "128": "TAKE THIS CLASS. It is so fun and I enjoyed coming to class. The professor is so nice, and his lectures are all very fun. He does not record lectures, but class is interesting to go to. You have to go to class and do the readings to do well on the exam. Overall, attainable A. There are only 3 exams with pretty much no curve. The averages are around 85. I would still take the class tho it is so good, my favorite class i've taken at northwestern by far.",
                    "129": "super fun class. class time is full of movie clips and laughter. the tests were a little hard but I also never did the reading, so if you dint read and just go off class material you can get a high C or low B in the class overall. Eli is such a silly guy I loved him.",
                    "130": "Pros<br>– This class probably saved my relationship with my partner. Not only did I learn about relationships, I also learnt how to be a better partner. This class should be required for any person who ever wants to be in any sort of relationship. Taking this with my partner has also created lots of common topics for us to reference as we navigate the complexities of a relationship. Overall, this may end up being the most important and life–changing class that I take at NU. Please, take this class if you can.<br>– Finkel may be the best professor I've had at Northwestern. He's definitely the best lecturer I've had. There's a reason why my friends who are not even taking this class regularly attend lectures for fun. Finkel is funny, engaging and effective. Classes are half informative lecturing, half stand up comedy that drives home the concepts. Finkel is also one of the leading researchers in the field, so it's pretty cool seeing him cited in the textbook. I wish more professors at NU were like him honestly.<br>– Class content is always interesting and relevant to daily life. Many of the topics are not things that I would have had a forum to discuss anywhere else, so I really appreciate the chance to explore them in this class. Also, Finkel discusses actionable insights for improving relationships, which I have put into practice in my current relationship.<br><br>Cons<br>– Grading can be tough because your entire grade depends on 3 multiple choice exams, and they had some tricky questions on them. That being said, I definitely could have done better if I had kept up with the readings, so make sure to read the readings!<br>– I wish there was a discussion session so I could talk about class content more, especially talking about how I can apply the content to daily life. That would enhance my learning even more and would probably be an awesome experience",
                    "131": "Very interesting course, very entertaining professor. I didn't need to do the reading because I had friends that helped me with reading specific items, but there are definitely things on the readings not on the lecture notes on the exams. <br>Attendance: Not Mandatory",

                    "133": "I really enjoyed this class because Finkel is such a great lecturer. Every lecture was very engaging and digestible. A lot of people don't do the readings but I recommend it because even though they aren't really discussed in class, the exams incorporate material from both lecture and the reading. If you study the exams are super doable.  Overall I would really recommend this class even if it has nothing to do with your major.",
                    "134": "This course was awesome. Professor Finkel was such a great professor and every lecture felt like a TED talk. It was so easy to review my notes for the exams because the lectures were so memorable. The class did require you to do all of the readings to really succeed on the exams and there were a lot of readings. The readings were mostly interesting though and the class was interesting as a whole. Your grade is made up of three exam grades and there is an opportunity for a little extra credit. I highly recommend this class.",
                    "135": "The lectures and slides for this class are exceptionally well organized. The lectures were engaging, I enjoyed that Finkel often included video clips from movies and tv shows since it creates a connection from class material to really concrete examples. There are three exams and they are all relatively straightforwad and not cumulative. The textbook was relatively interesting and Finkel's book which is assigned is also pretty good.",
                    "136": "Take this course! Professor Finkel is so engaging and teaches the material in such an interesting manner. I looked forward to attending his classes and the reading material was very interesting. This is definitely one of my favorite classes at NU.",
                    "137": "TAKE THIS CLASS! I had never taken a psych class prior to this, and after taking it, I've decided to take PSYCH 110 next quarter, am interested in getting involved in psych research, and am considering picking up a major or minor in psych. Professor Finkel is probably the best lecturer I have ever had, and he has the most helpful lecture slides. Class is not too difficult. Grades are entirely determined by three, 60 question multiple choice midterms. If you study the night before each one and do the extra credit you'll get a B+ or higher, and if you just stay on top of things getting an A is well within reach. Even if you've never taken a psych class or have just the slightest interest in the subject, this class will engage you and teach you lessons you can apply to your life. Great for a distro or elective. One of the best classes offered at Northwestern. If you're a first–quarter freshman and don't know what to take, take this. One of the best decisions I made in my first quarter at NU.",
                    "138": "HIGHLY RECOMMEND; each class is like a TED talk they are fun and easy to follow. Interesting topics throughout the course. 3 tests non–cumulative MC",
                    "139": "this class is awesome. prof Finkel is super engaging and funny, his lectures are easy to follow and fun, his answers questions well, the tests are harder than you'd expect and there's not any review materials, the readings are really interesting and there's no hw which is nice. some concepts aren't differentiated well enough so its tricky on the exams",
                    "140": "Professor Finkel is a really good lecturer and makes class time interesting and engaging for the most part.  I enjoyed taking the course as a chill and fun psych elective.",
                    "141": "I enjoyed this class so much and thought everything I learned was so important for any relationships. I appreciated the instruction and the enthusiasm that Prof Finkel added to each lecture. I do wish that we would at least go over the most important things we should know from the textbooks in class because there is a lot of information and it was hard to know what from the textbook would be fair game for tests. However, I think office hours are good for this and the TA's were always helpful before tests.",
                    "142": "SOOO much work. While this was a very interesting class, I found the readings to be a lot. There are several chapters of multiple books assigned before each class. The tests are also very nitpicky and difficult. So, while the content of the course is interesting, the class overall is very difficult.",
                    "143": "This class is super interesting–– content is fascinating and Prof Finkel's combination of lecture with the use of video clips / real life examples makes class extremely engaging. That being said, this class covers A LOT of content. Exams are DIFFICULT. I often finished exams feeling that I did pretty well after doing the mountains of readings and studying for days in advance, and am still barely scraping by with a passing grade. The exams aren't exactly tricky, but the sheer amount of content covered in class means that it's almost impossible to feel completely prepared going in. That being said, this is still a super fun and interesting class that will change the way you look at relationships as a whole, and I am glad that I took it.",
                    "144": "The course was great! Every class seemed like a TED talk because the material was very interesting and the Professor was a great lecturer. The exams are mc but they are actually hard, you need to read and study a lot for them.",
                    "145": "This is probably the coolest class I've ever taken. It was my first psychology class, and the amount I learned about relationships and the science behind the way we look at them was super cool. The exams are challenging with the amount of content covered, but the extra credit helps the grading a bit. Would 100% recommend.",
                    "146": "best class of all time. eli is hilarious. you talk and learn about such practical things. readings are a lot and are only hard part on exams tbh. know the important studies. he throws a couple questions on the exams that you wont get unless you guess or know like a little detail from class or something so dont stress too much. 4% added to grade for free. expect a B+. people will complain that the stuff is too biased towards heterosexual couples and he does not do a good enough job incorporating more inclusive stuff. this aint true, there just isnt that much research out there and he includes as much as he can",
                    "147": "This course was incredibly interesting. I really loved it; it has been my favorite class at Northwestern. I learned a lot during the course and Professor Finkel is an incredible lecturer. He really knows how to engage with his students.",
                    "148": "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS COURSE! Prof Finkel is an amazing lecturer and class was always super engaging. The topic itself is already interesting, and while the focus is on romantic relationships, the lecture information can also be applied to other kinds of relationships. The grade being based on only three exams is scary, but everything will be fine so long as you prep and make sure to read the textbook as well as the readings.",
                    "149": "Overall, the course gave me the opportunity to learn something I had never really heard of before. truly fun course to take!",
                    "150": "Very interesting and engaging lectures – you get to learn a lot about relationships and apply them to your life. However the exams are hard (all multiple choice) and the readings are a bit tedious.",
                    "151": "The class is fun but the only three grades are the three exams which is a little challenging",
                    "152": "This class was rly engaging and interesting. There's 3 multiple choice midterms if you want to get an A you have to do the readings. We usually watch short clips from movies/tv shows that really illustrate the concept that he's talking about. The class is mostly focused on romantic relationship and is pretty applicable to daily life.",
                    "153": "Take this course! Amazing lectures and the professor is SO SO good.",
                    "154": "This course was incredible. It was so interesting and Professor Finkle is super engaging. He is truly an amazing professor. Nothing was too difficult. Highly reccomend.",
                    "155": "Really engaging class – 3 tests and interesting, applicable lectures. Do the readings and take notes on lectures and you will do great.",
                    "156": "I really loved each class which taught me so much and engaged me in new topics. Each lecture was interesting and taught me so much.",
                    "157": "I can not recommend this course enough, whether you are a psych major or looking for a distro. This has by far been the best class I've taken at Northwestern, and I absolutely love Professor Finkel's style of teaching. It is not easy to make an 80–minute lecture interesting, but he makes the lectures feel super short with how engaging and entertaining they are at times. You can truly tell that he is an expert in his field, and his enthusiasm makes the class even more enjoyable. In terms of course content, it is super content heavy. There are a lot of topics that he discusses (every single one is interesting), but there are a TON of supplemental textbook/article readings as well as his book that make studying for his exams a lot of work. The exams are not easy, but they are manageable, and the three midterms are the sole things that determine your grade. I loved this class overall, and I wish he taught more classes.",
                    "158": "Grades are based 100% on exams but it is not super hard to do okay on the exams as long as you attend class and study the lectures. If you want to get an A though you have to do all the readings and these reading can be pretty heavy.",
                    "159": "A pretty good class! I think it was not as mind blowing as other CTECS made it out to be, but learned a lot of information that I think I can apply to relationships and even friendships moving forward. I noticed the way I processed emotions or navigated conflict was different because of this class! I think you do have to do the readings and attend class to do well on the midterms, but it's all very fair if you do.",
                    "160": "Seriously sad that I'm not going to be able to sit in this class again next quarter. Time flies when you're there. The readings are really long and you do need to study a good amount to do well in the class. It's also NOT an easy A whatsoever. Your entire grade is based off of three non–cumulative exams and nothing else except for some extra credit. I'd say even an A– is not easy by any means, but if you work hard it's definitely doable. The exams aren't hard, but there's little room for error. That being said, I'm sitting at a B+ borderline of an A– depending on the last exam, but I would recommend this class to anyone and everyone. It is SO worth your time. DO IT!!",
                    "161": "Take this course if you can. This course is one of the best at nu. Finkel is a great lecturer, engaging and interesting. The readings and lectures are interesting to the point you don't even realize it is for a class. There are 3 non cumulative midterms that are not tricky. This class is extremely interesting and fair. Absolutely loved this class",
                    "162": "Was a very fun class and as long as you prepare for the three tests its not too bad",
                    "163": "Absolutely loved everything about this class. 10/10 would recommend even if you are not very interested in social psychology.",
                    "164": "TAKE THIS CLASS TAKE THIS CLASS TAKE THIS CLASS!! Truly the most phenomenal course I've ever taken at Northwestern. Not only is the material so interesting and relevant (exploring the complexities of romantic relationships is SO fascinating), but Finkel is the most compelling lecturer I've ever had. He's so well–spoken and witty, and he was somehow able to keep 500+ students engaged every class. His use of movie clips to demonstrate each concept was such a clever and engaging technique—not only did they keep lectures interesting, but the real–world examples of the material really helped me understand the content. Readings didn't even feel like schoolwork because they were so fascinating, and exams were very fair. I actually looked forward to learning every class, and I was sad when it ended (that never happens!). Such a well–designed and interesting course. TAKE IT!!",
                    "165": "AMAZING CLASS IF YOU CAN TAKE IT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! It's not quite an easy A, but if you do the readings and pay attention during lectures (which you will) then you'll be okay. Professor Finkel is so awesome and is super passionate about this class. The lectures are super fun and the class is awesome.",
                    "166": "LOVED this class! Different from any other course I've taken at Northwestern.",
                    "167": "The class is definitely interesting but the readings took SO LONG. The exams were so specific so you can't get by with not reading. The class only consists of three midterms so it sucks if you mess up on one of them because your grade can't really recover. A lot of the readings and the lecture were repetitive and could've been concised immensely. Good job on Eli Finkel though for keeping the engagement in class. Lectures were pretty fun honestly.",
                    "168": "Prof. Finkel is a great lecturer. I loved going to his class because he made the content very engaging. The class is all lectures, with readings from a textbook, his book, and articles. The content is so interesting and applicable to life/relationships. The class is 3 midterms, and we finished before Thanksgiving break.",
                    "169": "This class is so fun! Prof Finkel is a very engaging lecturer: he includes video examples during class. The exams were not too hard but you need to do the readings because theres content tested that isn't mentioned in the lecture",
                    "170": "This course is super interesting. I didn't think I'd like it because I don't enjoy the anatomy/biology aspects of psychology, but the course was more social psychology focused and was engaging and cool. The 3 exams were somewhat difficult, which was a bit stressful because your grade in the class is just made up of those three tests, but if you study and do the extra credit you can definitely get an A. Overall I really enjoyed the course and would 10/10 recommend it.",
                    "171": "Take this course! I took it as a Freshman since I tested out of intro psych, and even still it felt like an interesting, engaging, and relatively easy psychology course to begin with. Professor Finkel is amazing and so, so engaging as a lecturer. Lectures were super enjoyable, informative, and funny. The 3 midterms were definitely not an easy A by any means, but they felt doable. Take the extra credit opportunities, and you should be fine. Also, NO FINAL!<br><br>I would say my one gripe with the course is its lack of focus on LGBTQ+ identities they basically had one lecture allocated to this taught by a TA student, but it didn't feel nearly as engaging or informative as other areas of the course. This is more so a problem with the field in general, though, so I can't blame this totally on anything that Professor Finkel is doing wrong. I would still suggest the course either way!",
                    "172": "Awesome course. Every person ever would benefit from taking this class.  Fair bit of work has to be put in to do well but very manageable and the stuff you learn is applicable to every relationship you have with anyone (platonic, romantic, family, etc.). Awesome and funny professor who engages the 300 person lecture hall.",
                    "173": "This was a very interesting class and lectures were actually fun to attend",
                    "174": "First off let me say this. This entire class is based off a pseudoscience. In the very first lecture they start off talking about why psychology is actually a scientific field, as they go on to prove within the courses that it is anything but scientific. There is a clear agenda that Professor Finkel is trying to push, which most of the psych majors fall for because  nu is all about being empowerment rather than any form of common decency for your anyone not yourself. They don't realize all this class is, is an advertisement for you to be Finkel's book, the all or nothing marriage, which might was well just be called the nothing marriage. Because after taking this class, that's how you feel. Love is dead. Western civilization is on the brink of collapse.  And if you want to make it to whatever dystopia this class predicts in the next year, all you have to do is incorporate the dark triad of personality traits into your identity. So if you meet any of the following criteria, you would be the ideal candidate for this class: i) crippling insecurity issues, ii) absent father, iii) belief that infidelity is righteous, iv) innate desire to gaslight and manipulate, and v) murderous rage at any person who gives the slightest inconvenience. This probably won't get posted to CTECs but if it does and if Finkel is reading this, I hope you are proud that you've corrupted the minds of good college students while empowering the 2% of psychopaths to go out on a MISSION to destroy any prosperity in love Americans could feel.",
                    "175": "The lectures for this class were entertaining, there are a lot of rom–com clips! My only complaint for this class is that there are 3 exams that determine your entire grade (plus some extra credit). You can for sure get a B if you put in the effort but an A is a little harder since there are no other grades. This was one best psych classes I have taken, but only having 3 exams to determine the entire grade spoils it a little bit. But Eli Finkle is an amazing and caring professor!",
                    "176": "Loved this class so much. Professor Finkel very clearly knows what he's talking about and does a great job of keeping the class entertained during his lectures. Barely any work outside of class and exams are very doable as long as you pay some attention during lecture and maybe review the slides and readings a few times. Super enjoyable class and I highly recommend to anyone who wants a fun class to take, whether it's for a major or distribution requirement or just for fun",
                    "177": "This course was so much fun to take. Learned a lot about something as practical as relationship advice while also not feeling overwhelmed by all the psych terminology.",
                    "178": "This course explored various intriguing topics in people's relationships that are pertinent to our daily lives. I was able to apply the theories and concepts from this course into my daily life and past experiences.",
                    "179": "SO glad I took this as a disto because it was absolutely one of the best classes I've taken at Northwestern. SUPER interesting material that is so life–relevant, and Prof. Finkel is awesome. Exams are not gimme points, but they are honestly a very good and fair metric of whether you studied. Literally loved this class and wish I would have majored in psych now, a little too late bc I'm a senior but OMG. Amazing. Take this class!!!",
                    "180": "I thought this class was fun (plus Prof. Finkel is a great lecturer!) but I thought the exams were tough at times so I'd only really recommend it if you think you're a good test taker. Since the course is only really based on 3 exams, it puts a lot of pressure to do well on each exam. I don't do too well with multiple choice so the exams were tough for me, but I thought the content was very interesting and the lectures always featured clips from rom–coms or shows which was fun!",
                    "181": "Lecture is more like a one hour educational standup comedy set, with movie clips sprinkled in. Material is interesting, professor is funny, midterms require you to study and do the reading, but typically aren't unreasonable. Good course.",
                    "182": "very interesting and applicable course, everything feels SO organized and controlled, exams and grading very fair, excellent prof",
                    "183": "MY FAVORITE CLASS EVER. Please take this class. Professor Finkel is hilarious and very engaging during lectures, it's hard to get distracted. Not to mention, all the topics are super interesting and many are relevant to real–life matters. I learned so much about myself and my own relationships in this class, I truly feel that I came out of it as a better person.",
                    "184": "I loved this course! I'm actually not even that interested in romantic relationships, mostly taking the course because my friends were in it. But the 80–minute lectures passed by quickly and I was extremely engaged the whole time. The professor is so enthusiastic, loves the topic, and is one of the most knowledgeable people in the world for this field of psychology.",
                    "185": "Aside from the exams being wonky at some points, the overall class content was enjoyable. The professor is great at teaching and has humor. I do wish the professor and TA’s provided practice exams before the actual exam since knowing definitions of concepts is different from knowing how to spot them in scenarios.",
                    "186": "I'm someone that easily falls asleep. And there were many days I would walk into class TIRED and ready to sleep. But suprisingly, I've only fallen asleep during one lecture. Which is pretty rare for me, especially for a lecture–based class. That is to say the lecture content is interesting and presented in an entertaining way. The Prof is funny and presents many examples using pop culture references that feel natural.",
                    "187": "TAKE THIS CLASS!! The professor is funny and engaging, and the lessons/lectures are very easy to follow. Just attend the class, pay attention, and take notes. I personally did none of the readings and was still able to achieve over a 90% on each of the exams. There is no other homework or assignments throughout the quarter, so as long as you study for the exam you're fine! The topics and information are also super interesting, so it makes it easy to study/remember. I applied so much of what I learned in this class to my own life and started psychoanalyzing all of my friends' relationships (as well as my own...). TAKE THIS CLASS!!!",
                    "188": "This was the most engaging and entertaining class I have taken at NU. Prof Finkel is the best professor I have experienced at NU. The class consists of just 3 multiple–choice exams which are very challenging but manageable.  I wouldn't describe the class as an easy A, but some of my friends got As. If you are good at multiple choice, it'll be pretty good but for me, I'm bad at multiple choice exams generally, but I am still looking at a grade in the B range.",
                    "189": "Finkel is such a great lecturer. Every class was so interesting and I was actually excited to learn about each concept. I would def recommend this class. The exams aren’t too bad you just have to really know your stuff because it gets pretty specific.",
                    "190": "Eli Finkel &lt;3 the best lecturer I’ve ever had, every lecture was so fun and so easy to understand. The tests were a little difficult/poorly written but other than that I love this class!",
                    "191": "Great class. Decently hard to be honest. But the material is so interesting way worth taking. Just do the readings and you will likely be fine.",
                    "192": "This course was so interesting and a lot of fun to take, BUT is by no means easy and a class that I had to accept a B in. Your ENTIRE GRADE is based only on 3 exams, each of which are 60 multiple choice questions, and then 4 extra credit points that don't really do much to help your grade. I feel like the tests didn't do a good job of seeing if you understood the material, because sometimes I felt like I understood everything and was prepared, but then did badly. Also the questions would sometimes be worded weirdly and because of the multiple choice format, I doubted myself a lot and kept switching between answers. I did very badly on the first test, which meant that 33% of my grade was already down the drain and I had to do really well on the next two to try and get it up. I wish the grade in the class was structured differently and your entire grade didn't only rely on what circles you filled in on 3 tests. Prof. Finkel is so funny and engaging and creates great lectures with interesting and relevant videos from good movies and TV shows. The only homework is readings from a textbook, Prof. Finkel's book, and sometimes an outside article, and they can get a little repetitive. You don't have to do the readings before class and can leave them until closer to the test date if you are busy in other classes. I ended up doing that and using the readings to prepare for the test and I don't know if that was the best method. My TA, Erin, was very kind and available to meet, but still I feel like the format of the test was so annoying and unfair that it made it difficult to do well in the class. The average for the first test two tests was 87, but I feel like most people I talked to weren't doing very well and an A seemed like a hard grade to get in this class unless multiple choice tests were a format you enjoy.",
                    "193": "I found the class very engaging and looked forward to going to lectures. However, the readings for the class were so long and honestly the majority of them felt unnecessary. I think it would be considerate if he gave specific pages that were important to read in the text instead of the whole textbook chapter with information we never talk about again.",
                    "194": "This is the type of class that you would like to sit and be a part of just as an outsider. The grade is made of three 60q exams + up to 4 percentages of extra credit added to final grade. Definitely review the outside readings for each exam, around 15% of each exam is not lecture–based.",
                    "195": "Amazing course, would def recommend to literally anyone. Finkel is a great lecturer; he's super engaging and always makes sure there's time for questions. There are three non–cumulative exams across the quarter– these are essentially the only things going into the grade book, so each one is a third of your final grade. This class is unfortunately really heavy on the readings, but if you skip all of them, you should still be able to get a passing grade !! (but don't expect an A without them, because Finkel pulls a decent amount of exam questions from the readings) All in all, if you have the option to take this class,, take it. Like 10/10, take it.",
                    "196": "Great class if interested in psychology and how it plays out in interactions with others. Helpful for those in relationships or for those who want to be. One of the best psychology classes I have taken at Northwestern. I liked the assessment structure with three exams, but no cumulative material. It was like high school and having \"unit\" tests. The learning format was easy to digest, the materials (textbook and print out readigns) supplemented what was taught in class, and Professor Finkel found ways to make it relatable.",
                    "197": "This class is awesome. These are some of the most engaging and entertaining lectures I've been to, and everything feels applicable/relevant to real life. Professor Finkel is super funny and knowledgeable and includes lots of pop culture examples in his slides to drive his points home. The class slides are also organized super well and have most of the information you need to study class material for the exams. The only downside is that there is a LOT of reading, especially at the beginning of the class, and you really do need to do the readings to do well on the exams. However, skimming/looking for key terms/examples in a pinch will help a lot, especially because it feels nearly impossible to get through everything when reading deeply and taking notes. But it's all worth it – 100% recommend this class the class materials and readings are all super accessible and interesting!",
                    "198": "This class was fantastic! Very interesting, and the way Dr. Finkel structured lectures made it easy to learn and understand what was going on. It was pretty straightforward, but Finked stopped frequently to answer questions. It was a bit heteronormative, and the two lectures that went beyond heterosexual couples weren't very thorough. Only three exams made up our grades and they were pretty straightforward as well! We read an easy–to–read textbook, supplemental readings, and a book Finkel wrote. Sometimes it felt like he centered his own relationship a bit much, but, hey, it was his lecture and his book, so it is what it is. Take this class!",
                    "199": "BEST CLASS EVEEERRRRRRRR! <br>Professor Finkel is an amazing and riveting lecturer. This was one of the BEST classes I've ever taken at Northwestern.<br>Only three midterms and you will end before reading week. <br>Lots of readings but if you stay on top of it, studying for exams won't be bad at all.",

She presents all subject in a fun, applicable, and easy to understand way. Course also has light workload, the final report is paced gradually throughout the course and not stressful at all. Would recommend this for anyone with interest in consumer psych or psych in general.",
                    "1": "This class was honestly so boring. Professor Pennington is just a huge talker and spends the entire course just talking during lectures. I wish there was more opportunity for work on our papers during class because it was hard to collect data and to finish up the paper towards the end. Honestly not my favorite class because I hate research and the course itself was disorganized.  The plus side is no exams, just weekly homework assignments that she uploads at the end of the week.",
                    "2": "Although the course content was interesting, the course was so disorganized that it made the course unenjoyable. We barely did any work for the first several weeks of the quarter and then were expected to conduct an experiment and produce an entire research paper within the last couple weeks. Besides the research paper, the other things that counted toward grades were weekly reading assignments, participation, and 4 research development worksheets. The weekly reading assignments were posted so late into the week (Thursday/Friday) and were expected to be turned in on Sunday. Also, besides the research paper, none of the assignments had a rubric. I think the course content was interesting, but the structure of it caused a lot of unnecessary stress late in the quarter.",

                    "4": "Love this course. Super straight forward and I learned so much. A lot of flexibility to explore something in consumer psych you are interested in",
                    "5": "The cumulative final project is really interesting and totally digestible as you work towards building it up throughout the quarter. Ginger is extremely responsive and helpful when needed during office hours. A fun marketing twist on a psychology course. Not much work outside of class other than weekly guided reading questions and the bi weekly worksheet that helps break down the final project.",
                    "6": "I learned a lot abotu consumerism! I look at real world stuff like brands and advertisements differently. super interesting to see how brain works and gets tricked  and what we pay attention to . NO TEST WHICH IS SO ALLEVIATING. work hard and dont fall behind and you'll be fine prof is super approachable and sweet.",
                    "7": "I thought this class was really interesting! Professor Pennington is super helpful with the final project, which definitely makes it seem more manageable. There is weekly homework worksheets, but they do not take very long. Attendance is graded, so make sure you attend lecture.",
                    "8": "Enjoyed this class. Professor Pennington took the time to provide a lot of feedback and was passionate about teaching us and helping with our projects. There is an ongoing project throughout the quarter with a final submission, and weekly reading assignment worksheets. The lectures were interesting with a good mix of discussion and collaboration as well."

I learned absolutely nothing new and it was hard to get myself to attend class as I felt like we were given busywork that was unnecessarily graded harshly. I hope this class improves its curriculum. The research project could have been more well integrated in the class materials. Professor Pennington was nice but I cannot say that she is a very good lecturer, especially when she recycles materials from her marketing class and often got confused as to which class heard which lecture.",
                    "2": "Great class! I took marketing with Pennington before this class, which definitely made things easier, but it would be totally doable without first taking that class in my opinion. Pennington is such a nice and engaging professor. I love all the ad case studies she went through in class, you can tell she gets a kick out of this stuff. I also like the focus on research and conducting studies which was not as big of a focus in marketing management. My one tip –– don't slack on the early assignments, because they will help you put together your final project at the end of the quarter. If you do thorough work for the assignments which make up the building blocks of the final project, you will save so much time and energy down the line.",

Grade based on 1–2 weekly discussion posts, and then a 12–15 page final paper on a topic of your choosing.",
                    "1": "A worthwhile course if you're curious of exploring the differences in practices/culture in clinical vs academic psychology. Broad survey of literature surrounding different clinical therapies and their efficacy. Professor Broaders can be a harsh grader, and it isn't always clear what she's looking for in writing assignments. Go to office hours and seek feedback if you want to do well.",

                    "3": "This was a great course! It was definitely reading–intensive, however, the content was very interesting. The workload included an annotated bibliography presentation, leading a class discussion, weekly short responses based on the readings, and a final paper. I would not say this course is an easy A, but it did provide me with a lot of interesting insight into the field of clinical psychology. I would definitely recommend it!",
                    "4": "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Northwestern! It has honestly made me reflect so much on the importance of evidence based treatment, and how important it is to my own future career in psychology. The topics were fascinating, and class discussions were super lively. Prof. Broaders is no–nonsense, but she also knows how to run an incredible class. However, this class IS a challenge – there is a lot of reading, two writing assignments due per week, two sizable projects, and a huge final paper. Worth it!"

As long as you read the papers for the week and showed up to discussion, you should be fine. My only concerns for this class was that the reaction papers didn't have as clear as a grading criteria. Quizzes seemed pretty straight forward, we were allowed 2 drops out of the 8. Prof. Beeman is super passionate about the field of cognitive neuroscience and I definitely learned a lot. He wanted to choose papers based on what we were interested in and having an opportunity to present a paper really helped my own presentation skills when it came time to present my own research poster later in the quarter. I appreciated this input to my work and am really glad I took this course despite not being a neuro or psych major.",

He's a pretty nice guy though and offers flexibility when needed.",

I also liked the symposium at the end of the course, it was great practice for future research projects and presentations.",

From the start, she trusted and encouraged us to come up with our own research process, offering guidance along the way. Her steadfast confidence in us made this experience even more exciting. It is evident that Professor Waxman's priority is making sure her students are learning the material in a way that resonates with them. I highly recommend this course with her. While it does require some commitment outside of class since you are required to write a research proposal during the quarter, I suggest attending office hours with the professor and scheduling weekly group meetings to ease the workload.",
                    "4": "This was probably my favorite class I've taken at Northwestern. Essentially the class is a long–term group project where you plan and write a research proposal. Taking this while working on a thesis has been incredibly helpful – although I wish I could've taken it sooner.",
                    "5": "I had really high hopes for this class, but it really fell short of my expectations. The subject matter was interesting, but I wouldn't take this class unless you have a really good background in developmental psych because it is difficult to understand the studies on critical periods and development if you don't have a full grasp on this topic (developmental was not necessarily a requirement, but it should be and was treated as such). The fact that there are no grades in the grade book for the entire quarter was also quite stressful, as I didn't know how I stood in the class. I wanted to take a research seminar so that I could learn to write lit reviews and proposals under the mentorship of a professional in the field, but Waxman was not a good mentor for less experienced researchers. She didn't know how to answer basic questions, failed to explain basic components of a lit review and proposal, and gave very minimal support other than revisions with comments that were hard to understand. She's a brilliant researcher, but she doesn't know how to teach. At times, it felt like the only members of the class she taught with respect were those in her lab. The class just didn't feel equitable and I think I could have learned so much more with more organized and supportive instruction.",
                    "6": "It’s a 3 hour class but a lot of classes are used just to give you time to complete the project. There are a lot of presentations, it’s a good class and the grading wasn’t strict but it can still be stressful. Overall, an easy class as long as you do the work",
                    "7": "This class was really lovely.  We mostly focused on group work, which was so much more productive than you would anticipate. My research group were pretty good pals by the end, and we all ‘became experts’ in one specific field.  If you enjoy psychology and research, I would advise you take this class. Professor Waxman is also such an incredible mentor. She is very passionate and knowledgeable. She definitely ensures the class is student–led, and that everyone is included and engaged. Great Row2 class, easy A if you are committed to the work."

Professor Nusslock does an incredible job of explaining all the material and making the class inclusive for everyone, regardless of their background in Neuroscience. It is discussion–based and includes essays instead of exams, so there is no pressure to memorize information, which I felt really improved my learning experience and allowed me to engage with the material more than I have done in other psychology classes. Overall, I would highly recommend this class!",

Professor Nusslock is so kind, interesting, and smart and he genuinely cares so much about his students. The class structure is discussion posts for every class which can get tiring, but there are no exams at all. There are two essays that are work but are not graded harshly by any means. The experience of writing these essays are also awesome as you get to choose any neuro or psych topic to do a deep dive into, which to me was very cool because I got to learn a lot about topics I was very curious about. The biggest draw to this class is the amazing discussions that take place during class and the topics Professor Nusslock introduces that study the neurobiological basis to mood disorders.  I cannot stress more how wonderful this class is and how much you need to take it.  Professor Nusslock is so humble but truly is one of the smartest people I've ever met. I've grown so much from this class and it has made me enjoy being a student. Just take it.",
                    "7": "Overall, pretty interesting course. Professor Nusslock is great and makes the lectures very engaging. I highly recommend taking a course with him if you have the chance. There's only two big papers and 2 weekly discussion posts. The discussion posts felt tedious, but the papers are graded very fairly. A lot of content is covered throughout the course and it is very helpful to have a neuroscience background for this course, but overall you don't necessarily need to understand everything and you definitely don't need to memorize anything to be successful in the course.",
                    "8": "Only two papers, so it’s easy and Robin Nusslock is very nice and a good lecturer. But personally the course felt very disorganized and it didn’t feel like I really learned much. The papers didn’t have to have anything to do with the lectures so if participation wasn’t a factor I could’ve gotten an A without wasting my time at any of the lectures. I was expecting it to be more discussion based but it was mostly the professor talking at us about what seemed like random topics that popped into his head. Also the content was not was I was expecting it to be, it felt very pseudo–sciencey talking about meditation and whatnot in a course that I expected to be more neuroscience focused.",
                    "9": "I loved this class. I always appreciate Professor Nusslock for teaching classes that explain the neuroscience behind psychology, as I think understanding how the brain works internally is very important in the study of psychology and for where the field is headed. Classes were a combination of lecture and discussion. Work for the class was manageable, with readings, 2 discussion questions due for each class, a 6–7 page literature review, and another 6–7 page lit review with an added research proposal for the final. Both papers were on topics of our choice. Aside from the content being extremely important and interesting, Professor Nusslock is an absolute gem. He cares so much about us doing well and inputs information from sources we may not have been familiar with before like Buddhism. Even if he didn't know the answer to our questions, he would try to give us places to look and literature to read. I absolutely recommend taking a class with him if you have the chance. Overall I feel this class is a must–take if you can get into it.",
                    "10": "Great higher level psych class, I wish it had been smaller to allow for better discussion, however, the class was mostly lecture based. With no tests/quizzes, it was hard to f once myself to pay attention sometimes –– but there was no penalty for not paying attention except your own learning. The two papers give you a lot of freedom to research whatever you are interested in (and did not even have to be neuroscience related). Overall, great class, Professor Nusslock is great. Lectures were personal and engaging, highly recommend. I also had no neuroscience background (have not even taken intro to neuro), but did just fine bc there were no tests/quizzes!",
                    "11": "I really like Prof. Nusslock! He is engaged in everything he teaches and always has a good time leading our discussions. I enjoyed the class environment we had.",
                    "12": "I was scared taking this course because I am not a neuroscience major, but professor is super understanding and explains topics very well so it’s easy to understand",
                    "13": "Emotional Brain with Professor Nusslock was an amazing class. Even with little Neuroscience background, I was able to follow along thanks to Professor Nusslock's engaging and detailed lectures. The class covers fascinating topics that I would recommend anyone interested in emotions and their psychological workings to consider taking! The weekly readings and discussion questions were manageable and enjoyable. That being said, the two 6–8 page literature review papers can be a little overwhelming, so it would be a good idea to start working on those early and always consult with Professor Nusslock on any questions and concerns.",
                    "14": "Take this class with Prof. Robin. He is the best.",
                    "15": "Professor Nusslock is awesome and a fun lecturer. Most STEM professors are intense and sometimes unrelatable, but Nusslock makes himself approachable and excites the idea of pursuing academia. The class was pretty straightforward. Two papers and discussion questions. Definitely doable, but the discussion questions are pretty much just busywork. Never addressed in class but take a long time which was a pain. Overall worth taking though",
                    "16": "Great class for upper level research requirement. Professor Nusslock is well respected among psych students for his ability to articulate ideas and engage his students. I would take this class if you have an interest in the emotional brain, or if you struggle to find an interesting class for the upper level requirement. The class requirements are pretty chill too! The professor cares about you and wants to make us as stress free as possible",
                    "17": "This is a great class and Prof. Nusslock is amazing! He is so smart, but also so kind, and really made this class accessible to students that don't have neuroscience backgrounds.  The syllabus also includes a lot of really interesting topics that can be applied to your life. Our class also had the pleasure of having visiting monastics attend for part of the quarter so it was a  truly amazing opportunity to have their insight on topics like morality and compassion. It's a seminar so ask questions and engage if you have the opportunity to take this class!",
                    "18": "The professor is amazing, super supportive. You can learn a lot from the class, though I recommend going into the class with some interest in neuroscience.",
                    "19": "I think this course was interesting! A lot of it was content from intro to neuro, so some content felt repetitive at times, but I think the readings allowed for a new perspective that differed from the content in that class. The midterm paper topics were approved out loud in class which was actually pretty helpful because we were able to get live feedback and suggestions on the kind of research we could look at as we develop our papers. The papers  required a lot of effort, but they were graded fairly and thoughtfully.",
                    "20": "I loved this course. Professor Nusslock is a great lecturer and engaged the class. The readings were not too much but were very informative; there are discussion posts (post two questions about the readings) for every class. There are no exams which makes this class less stressful but just as rewarding. If you're interested in this topic, I'd highly recommend it!",
                    "21": "This was an amazing course! Professor Nusslock is so knowledgeable and wise, and he is very passionate but also humble about what he researches and teaches. The course explores the intersection of neuroscience with emotions, mental health, morality, and free will/consciousness, and I not only learned so much about neuroscience but also wise life lessons. There are two research papers throughout the quarter that need to incorporate ideas from neuroscience but do not have to be related to class material. The lecture materials are not tested but it was still really worth it to engage with all the content!"
