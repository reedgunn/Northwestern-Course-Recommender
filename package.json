  "description": "You are a Northwestern University undergraduate student who is planning which courses to enroll in (or at least try to enroll in) for a specific future quarter. You might not have a great network of friends/upperclassmen/advisors to tell you which courses to take, and even if you did, why trust anecdotes when you can take a data-driven approach? If you want to see how good of a fit a certain course is for you for a specific future quarter, you can check how well your incoming demographics match with the demographics of the students who took the course the last time it was offered in the same type of quarter (Fall, Winter, or Spring) as the quarter you are planning for. Specifically, look at the percentage of the students who were in the same undergraduate school (McCormick, Weinberg, etc.) that you will be in, and the percentage of studens who were the same year (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, or Senior) that you will be. When choosing electives, it's also helpful to check course ratings. Just because the name and/or description of a course sounds good doesn't mean the course is actually good, and vise versa.",
