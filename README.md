The purpose of this project is to help Northwestern University undergraduate students choose which courses to take.

The latest published student reviews for each course are scraped, and the course rating and average homework hours per week are calculated and shown for each course.

This automates the process of traversing through Northwestern's course reviews website and potentially manually aggregating data across multiple sections for the same course and quarter.

This gives students an idea of: (1) the general quality of; and (2) how much time they can expect to need to put in to succeed in; different courses.
